Introduction to Elm\nElm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It helps you make websites and web apps. It has a strong emphasis on simplicity and quality tooling.\nThis guide will:\n\nTeach you the fundamentals of programming in Elm.\nShow you how to make interactive apps with The Elm Architecture.\nEmphasize principles and patterns that generalize to programming in any language.\n\nBy the end I hope you will not only be able to create great web apps in Elm, but also understand the core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.\nIf you are on the fence, I can safely guarantee that if you give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will end up writing better JavaScript code. The ideas transfer pretty easily!\nA Quick Sample\nHere is a little program that lets you increment and decrement a number:\nimport Browser\nimport Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)\nimport Html.Events exposing (onClick)\n\n\nmain =\n    Browser.sandbox { init = 0, update = update, view = view }\n\n\ntype Msg\n    = Increment\n    | Decrement\n\n\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        Increment ->\n            model + 1\n\n        Decrement ->\n            model - 1\n\n\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text \"-\" ]\n        , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]\n        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text \"+\" ]\n        ]\n\nTry it out in the online editor here.\nThe code can definitely look unfamiliar at first, so we will get into how this example works soon!\nWhy a functional language?\nYou can get some benefits from programming in a functional style, but there are some things you can only get from a functional language like Elm:\n\nNo runtime errors in practice.\nFriendly error messages.\nReliable refactoring.\nAutomatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.\n\nNo combination of JS libraries can give you all of these guarantees. They come from the design of the language itself! And thanks to these guarantees, it is quite common for Elm programmers to say they never felt so confident while programming. Confident to add features quickly. Confident to refactor thousands of lines. But without the background anxiety that you missed something important!\nI have put a huge emphasis on making Elm easy to learn and use, so all I ask is that you give Elm a shot and see what you think. I hope you will be pleasantly surprised!\n"},"architecture/":{"url":"architecture/","title":"The Elm Architecture","keywords":"","body":"The Elm Architecture\nThe Elm Architecture is a pattern for architecting interactive programs, like webapps and games.\nThis architecture seems to emerge naturally in Elm. Rather than someone inventing it, early Elm programmers kept discovering the same basic patterns in their code. It was kind of spooky to see people ending up with well-architected code without planning ahead!\nSo The Elm Architecture is easy in Elm, but it is useful in any front-end project. In fact, projects like Redux have been inspired by The Elm Architecture, so you may have already seen derivatives of this pattern. Point is, even if you ultimately cannot use Elm at work yet, you will get a lot out of using Elm and internalizing this pattern.\nThe Basic Pattern\nElm programs always look something like this:\n\nThe Elm program produces HTML to show on screen, and then the computer sends back messages of what is going on. \"They clicked a button!\"\nWhat happens within the Elm program though? It always breaks into three parts:\n\nModel — the state of your application\nView — a way to turn your state into HTML\nUpdate — a way to update your state based on messages\n\nThese three concepts are the core of The Elm Architecture.\nThe next few examples are going to show how to use this pattern for user input, like buttons and text fields.

What is the main value doing? How do the different parts fit together? Let's go through the code and talk about it.\n\nNote: The code here uses type annotations, type aliases, and custom types. The point of this section is to get a feeling for The Elm Architecture though, so we will not cover them until a bit later. I encourage you to peek ahead if you are getting stuck on these aspects!\n\nMain\nThe main value is special in Elm. It describes what gets shown on screen. In this case, we are going to initialize our application with the init value, the view function is going to show everything on screen, and user input is going to be fed into the update function. Think of this as the high-level description of our program.\nModel\nData modeling is extremely important in Elm. The point of the model is to capture all the details about your application as data.\nTo make a counter, we need to keep track of a number that is going up and down. That means our model is really small this time:\ntype alias Model =\n    Int\n\nWe just need an Int value to track the current count. We can see that in our initial value:\ninit : Model\ninit =\n    0\n\nThe initial value is zero, and it will go up and down as people press different buttons.\nView\nWe have a model, but how do we show it on screen? That is the role of the view function:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text \"-\" ]\n        , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]\n        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text \"+\" ]\n        ]\n\nThis function takes in the Model as an argument. It outputs HTML. So we are saying that we want to show a decrement button, the current count, and an increment button.\nNotice that we have an onClick handler for each button. These are saying: when someone clicks, generate a message. So the plus button is generating an Increment message. What is that and where does it go? To the update function!\nUpdate\nThe update function describes how our Model will change over time.\nWe define two messages that it might receive:\ntype Msg\n    = Increment\n    | Decrement\n\nFrom there, the update function just describes what to do when you receive one of these messages.\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        Increment ->\n            model + 1\n\n        Decrement ->\n            model - 1\n\nIf you get an Increment message, you increment the model. If you get a Decrement message, you decrement the model.\nSo whenever we get a message, we run it through update to get a new model. We then call view to figure out how to show the new model on screen. Then repeat! User input generates a message, update the model, view it on screen. Etc.\nOverview\nNow that you have seen all the parts of an Elm program, it may be a bit easier to see how they fit into the diagram we saw earlier:\n\nElm starts by rendering the initial value on screen. From there you enter into this loop:\n\nWait for user input.\nSend a message to update\nProduce a new Model\nCall view to get new HTML\nShow the new HTML on screen\nRepeat!\n\nThis is the essence of The Elm Architecture. Every example we see from now on will be a slight variation on this basic pattern.\n\nExercise: Add a button to reset the counter to zero:\n\nAdd a Reset variant to the Msg type\nAdd a Reset branch in the update function\nAdd a button in the view function.\n\nYou can edit the example in the online editor here.\nIf that goes well, try adding another button to increment by steps of 10.\n\n"},"architecture/text_fields.html":{"url":"architecture/text_fields.html","title":"Text Fields","keywords":"","body":"Text Fields\nWe are about to create a simple app that reverses the contents of a text field.\nClick the blue button to look at this program in the online editor.

You set up a model. You define some messages. You say how to update. You make your view. The difference is just in how we filled this skeleton in. Let's walk through that!\nModel\nI always start by guessing at what my Model should be. We know we have to keep track of whatever the user has typed into the text field. We need that information to know how to render the reversed text. So we go with this:\ntype alias Model =\n    { content : String\n    }\n\nThis time I chose to represent the model as a record. The record stores the user input in the content field.\n\nNote: You may be wondering, why bother having a record if it only holds one entry? Couldn't you just use the string directly? Sure! But starting with a record makes it easy to add more fields as our app gets more complicated. When the time comes where we want two text inputs, we will have to do much less fiddling around.\n\nView\nWe have our model, so I usually proceed by creating a view function:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ input [ placeholder \"Text to reverse\", value model.content, onInput Change ] []\n        , div [] [ text (String.reverse model.content) ]\n        ]\n\nWe create a  with two children. The interesting child is the  node which has three attributes:\n\nplaceholder is the text that shows when there is no content\nvalue is the current content of this \nonInput sends messages when the user types in this  node\n\nTyping in \"bard\" this would produce four messages:\n\nChange \"b\"\nChange \"ba\"\nChange \"bar\"\nChange \"bard\"\n\nThese would be fed into our update function.\nUpdate\nThere is only one kind of message in this program, so our update only has to handle one case:\ntype Msg\n    = Change String\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        Change newContent ->\n            { model | content = newContent }\n\nWhen we receive a message that the  node has changed, we update the content of our model. So if you typed in \"bard\" the resulting messages would produce the following models:\n\n{ content = \"b\" }\n{ content = \"ba\" }\n{ content = \"bar\" }\n{ content = \"bard\" }\n\nWe need to track this information explicitly in our model, otherwise there is no way to show the reversed text in our view function!\n\nExercise: Go to the example in the online editor here and show the length of the content in your view function. Use the String.length function!\nNote: If you want more info on exactly how the Change values are working in this program, jump ahead to the sections on custom types and pattern matching.\n\n"},"architecture/forms.html":{"url":"architecture/forms.html","title":"Forms","keywords":"","body":"Forms\nNow we will make a rudimentary form.

We know there are going to be three text fields, so let's just go with that:\ntype alias Model =\n    { name : String\n    , password : String\n    , passwordAgain : String\n    }\n\nI usually try to start with a minimal model, maybe with just one field. I then attempt to write the view and update functions. That often reveals that I need to add more to my Model. Building the model gradually like this means I can have a working program through the development process. It may not have all the features yet, but it is getting there!\nUpdate\nSometimes you have a pretty good idea of what the basic update code will look like. We know we need to be able to change our three fields, so we need messages for each case.\ntype Msg\n    = Name String\n    | Password String\n    | PasswordAgain String\n\nThis means our update needs a case for all three variations:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> Model\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        Name name ->\n            { model | name = name }\n\n        Password password ->\n            { model | password = password }\n\n        PasswordAgain password ->\n            { model | passwordAgain = password }\n\nEach case uses the record update syntax to make sure the appropriate field is transformed. This is similar to the previous example, except with more cases.\nWe get a little bit fancier than normal in our view though.\nView\nThis view function is using helper functions to make things a bit more organized:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ viewInput \"text\" \"Name\" model.name Name\n        , viewInput \"password\" \"Password\" model.password Password\n        , viewInput \"password\" \"Re-enter Password\" model.passwordAgain PasswordAgain\n        , viewValidation model\n        ]\n\nIn previous examples we were using input and div directly. Why did we stop?\nThe neat thing about HTML in Elm is that input and div are just normal functions. They take (1) a list of attributes and (2) a list of child nodes. Since we are using normal Elm functions, we have the full power of Elm to help us build our views! We can refactor repetitive code out into customized helper functions. That is exactly what we are doing here!\nSo our view function has three calls to viewInput:\nviewInput : String -> String -> String -> (String -> msg) -> Html msg\nviewInput t p v toMsg =\n    input [ type_ t, placeholder p, value v, onInput toMsg ] []\n\nThis means that writing viewInput \"text\" \"Name\" \"Bill\" Name in Elm would turn into an HTML value like  when shown on screen.\nThe fourth entry is more interesting. It is a call to viewValidation:\nviewValidation : Model -> Html msg\nviewValidation model =\n    if model.password == model.passwordAgain then\n        div [ style \"color\" \"green\" ] [ text \"OK\" ]\n\n    else\n        div [ style \"color\" \"red\" ] [ text \"Passwords do not match!\" ]\n\nThis function first compares the two passwords. If they match, you get green text and a positive message. If they do not match, you get red text and a helpful message.\nThese helper functions begin to show the benefits of having our HTML library be normal Elm code. We could put all that code into our view, but making helper functions is totally normal in Elm, even in view code. \"Is this getting hard to understand? Maybe I can break out a helper function!\"\n\nExercises: Go look at this example in the online editor here. Try to add the following features to the viewValidation helper function:\n\nCheck that the password is longer than 8 characters.\nMake sure the password contains upper case, lower case, and numeric characters.\n\nUse the functions from the String module for these exercises!\nWarning: We need to learn a lot more before we start sending HTTP requests. Keep reading all the way to the section on HTTP before trying it yourself. It will be significantly easier with proper guidance!\nNote: It seems like efforts to make generic validation libraries have not been too successful. I think the problem is that the checks are usually best captured by normal Elm functions. Take some args, give back a Bool or Maybe. E.g. Why use a library to check if two strings are equal? So as far as we know, the simplest code comes from writing the logic for your particular scenario without any special extras. So definitely give that a shot before deciding you need something more complex!\n\n"},"types/":{"url":"types/","title":"Types","keywords":"","body":"Types\nOne of Elm's major benefits is that users do not see runtime errors in practice. This is possible because the Elm compiler can analyze your source code very quickly to see how values flow through your program. If a value can ever be used in an invalid way, the compiler tells you about it with a friendly error message. This is called type inference. The compiler figures out what type of values flow in and out of all your functions.\nAn Example of Type Inference\nThe following code defines a toFullName function which extracts a person’s full name as a string:\ntoFullName person =\n    person.firstName ++ \" \" ++ person.lastName\n\n\nfullName =\n    toFullName { fistName = \"Hermann\", lastName = \"Hesse\" }\n\nLike in JavaScript or Python, we just write the code with no extra clutter. Do you see the bug though?\nIn JavaScript, the equivalent code spits out \"undefined Hesse\". Not even an error! Hopefully one of your users will tell you about it when they see it in the wild. In contrast, the Elm compiler just looks at the source code and tells you:\n-- TYPE MISMATCH ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe argument to function `toFullName` is causing a mismatch.\n\n6│   toFullName { fistName = \"Hermann\", lastName = \"Hesse\" }\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFunction `toFullName` is expecting the argument to be:\n\n    { …, firstName : … }\n\nBut it is:\n\n    { …, fistName : … }\n\nHint: I compared the record fields and found some potential typos.\n\n    firstName  fistName\nIt sees that toFullName is getting the wrong type of argument. Like the hint in the error message says, someone accidentally wrote fist instead of first.\nIt is great to have an assistant for simple mistakes like this, but it is even more valuable when you have hundreds of files and a bunch of collaborators making changes. No matter how big and complex things get, the Elm compiler checks that everything fits together properly just based on the source code.\nThe better you understand types, the more the compiler feels like a friendly assistant. So let's start learning more!\n"},"types/pattern_matching.html":{"url":"types/pattern_matching.html","title":"Pattern Matching","keywords":"","body":"Pattern Matching\nOn the previous page, we learned how to create custom types with the type keyword. Our primary example was a User in a chat room:\ntype User\n    = Regular String Int\n    | Visitor String\n\nRegulars have a name and age, whereas visitors only have a name. So we have our custom type, but how do we actually use it?\ncase\nSay we want a toName function that decides on a name to show for each User. We need to use a case expression:\ntoName : User -> String\ntoName user =\n    case user of\n        Regular name age ->\n            name\n\n        Visitor name ->\n            name\n\n\n\n-- toName (Regular \"Thomas\" 44) == \"Thomas\"\n-- toName (Visitor \"kate95\")    == \"kate95\"\n\nThe case expression allows us to branch based on which variant we happen to see, so whether we see Thomas or Kate, we always know how to show their name.\nAnd if we try invalid arguments like toName (Visitar \"kate95\") or toName Anonymous, the compiler tells us about it immediately. This means many simple mistakes can be fixed in seconds, rather than making it to users and costing a lot more time overall.\nWild Cards\nThe toName function we just defined works great, but notice that the age is not used in the implementation? When some of the associated data is unused, it is common to use a “wild card” instead of giving it a name:\ntoName : User -> String\ntoName user =\n    case user of\n        Regular name _ ->\n            name\n\n        Visitor name ->\n            name\n\nThe _ acknowledges the data there, but also saying explicitly that nobody is using it.\n"},"error_handling/":{"url":"error_handling/","title":"Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling\nOne of the guarantees of Elm is that you will not see runtime errors in practice. This is partly because Elm treats errors as data. Rather than crashing, we model the possibility of failure explicitly with custom types. For example, say you want to turn user input into an age. You might create a custom type like this:\ntype MaybeAge\n  = Age Int\n  | InvalidInput\n\ntoAge : String -> MaybeAge\ntoAge userInput =\n  ...\n\n-- toAge \"24\" == Age 24\n-- toAge \"99\" == Age 99\n-- toAge \"ZZ\" == InvalidInput\n\nNo matter what input is given to the toAge function, it always produces a value. Valid input produces values like Age 24 and Age 99, whereas invalid input produces the InvalidInput value. From there, we use pattern matching which will ensure that both possibilities are accounted for. No crashing!\nThis kind of thing comes up all the time! For example, maybe you want to turn a bunch of user input into a Post to share with others. But what happens if they forget to add a title? Or there is no content in the post? We could model all these problems explicitly:\ntype MaybePost\n  = Post { title : String, content : String }\n  | NoTitle\n  | NoContent\n\ntoPost : String -> String -> MaybePost\ntoPost title content =\n  ...\n\n-- toPost \"hi\" \"sup?\" == Post { title = \"hi\", content = \"sup?\" }\n-- toPost \"\"   \"\"     == NoTitle\n-- toPost \"hi\" \"\"     == NoContent\n\nInstead of just saying that the input is invalid, we are describing each of the ways things might have gone wrong. If we have a viewPreview : MaybePost -> Html msg function to preview valid posts, now we can give more specific error messages in the preview area when something goes wrong!\nThese kinds of situations are extremely common. It is often valuable to create a custom type for your exact situation, but in some of the simpler cases, you can use an off-the-shelf type instead. So the rest of this chapter explores the Maybe and Result types, showing how they can help you treat errors as data!\n"},"error_handling/result.html":{"url":"error_handling/result.html","title":"Result","keywords":"","body":"Result\nThe Maybe type can help with simple functions that may fail, but it does not tell you why it failed. Imagine if a compiler just said Nothing if anything was wrong with your program. Good luck figuring out what went wrong!\nThis is where the Result type becomes helpful. It is defined like this:\ntype Result error value\n    = Ok value\n    | Err error\n\nThe point of this type is to give additional information when things go wrong. It is really helpful for error reporting and error recovery!\nError Reporting\nPerhaps we have a website where people input their age. We could check that the age is reasonable with a function like this:\nisReasonableAge : String -> Result String Int\nisReasonableAge input =\n    case String.toInt input of\n        Nothing ->\n            Err \"That is not a number!\"\n\n        Just age ->\n            if age  135 then\n                Err \"Are you some kind of turtle?\"\n\n            else\n                Ok age\n\n\n\n-- isReasonableAge \"abc\" == Err ...\n-- isReasonableAge \"-13\" == Err ...\n-- isReasonableAge \"24\"  == Ok 24\n-- isReasonableAge \"150\" == Err ...\n\nNot only can we check the age, but we can also show people error messages depending on the particulars of their input. This kind of feedback is much better than Nothing!\nError Recovery\nThe Result type can also help you recover from errors. One place you see this is when making HTTP requests. Say we want to show the full text of Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. Our HTTP request results in a Result Error String to capture the fact that the request may succeed with the full text, or it may fail in a bunch of different ways:\ntype Error\n    = BadUrl String\n    | Timeout\n    | NetworkError\n    | BadStatus Int\n    | BadBody String\n\n\n\n-- Ok \"All happy ...\" : Result Error String\n-- Err Timeout        : Result Error String\n-- Err NetworkError   : Result Error String\n\nFrom there we can show nicer error messages as we discussed before, but we can also try to recover from the failure! If we see a Timeout it may work to wait a little while and try again. Whereas if we see a BadStatus 404 then there is no point in trying again.\nThe next chapter shows how to actually make HTTP requests, so we will run into the Result and Error types again very soon!\n"},"effects/":{"url":"effects/","title":"Commands and Subscriptions","keywords":"","body":"Commands and Subscriptions\nEarlier in this book we saw The Elm Architecture handle mouse and keyboard interactions, but what about talking to servers?

This will explain why things work a bit differently than in languages like JavaScript, Python, etc.\nsandbox\nI have not made a big deal about it, but so far all of our programs were created with Browser.sandbox. We gave an initial Model and describe how to update and view it.\nYou can think of Browser.sandbox as setting up a system like this:\n\nWe get to stay in the world of Elm, writing functions and transforming data. This hooks up to Elm’s runtime system. The runtime system figures out how to render Html efficiently. Did anything change? What is the minimal DOM modification needed? It also figures out when someone clicks a button or types into a text field. It turns that into a Msg and feeds it into your Elm code.\nBy cleanly separating out all the DOM manipulation, it becomes possible to use extremely aggressive optimizations. So Elm’s runtime system is a big part of why Elm is one of the fastest options available.\nelement\nIn the next few examples, we are going to use Browser.element to create programs. This will introduce the ideas of commands and subscriptions which allow us to interact with the outside world.\nYou can think of Browser.element as setting up a system like this:\n\nIn addition to producing Html values, our programs will also send Cmd and Sub values to the runtime system. In this world, our programs can command the runtime system to make an HTTP request or to generate a random number. They can also subscribe to the current time.\nI think commands and subscriptions make more sense when you start seeing examples, so let’s do that!\n\nNote 1: Some readers may be worrying about asset size. “A runtime system? That sounds big!” It is not! In fact, Elm assets are exceptionally small when compared to popular alternatives.\nNote 2: We are going to use packages from package.elm-lang.org in the upcoming examples. We have already been working with a couple:\n\nelm/core\nelm/html\n\nBut now we will start getting into some fancier ones:\n\nelm/http\nelm/json\nelm/random\nelm/time\n\nThere are tons of other packages on package.elm-lang.org though!

We still have a Model of our application. We still have an update that reacts to messages. We still have a view function that shows everything on screen.\nThe new parts extend the core pattern we saw before with some changes in init and update, and the addition of subscription.\ninit\nThe init function describes how to initialize our program:\ninit : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit _ =\n    ( Loading\n    , Http.get\n        { url = \"https://elm-lang.org/assets/public-opinion.txt\"\n        , expect = Http.expectString GotText\n        }\n    )\n\nLike always, we have to produce the initial Model, but now we are also producing some command of what we want to do immediately. That command will eventually produce a Msg that gets fed into the update function.\nOur book website starts in the Loading state, and we want to GET the full text of our book. When making a GET request with Http.get, we specify the url of the data we want to fetch, and we specify what we expect that data to be. So in our case, the url is pointing at some data on the Elm website, and we expect it to be a big String we can show on screen.\nThe Http.expectString GotText line is saying a bit more than that we expect a String though. It is also saying that when we get a response, it should be turned into a GotText message:\ntype Msg\n    = GotText (Result Http.Error String)\n\n\n\n-- GotText (Ok \"The Project Gutenberg EBook of ...\")\n-- GotText (Err Http.NetworkError)\n-- GotText (Err (Http.BadStatus 404))\n\nNotice that we are using the Result type from a couple sections back. This allows us to fully account for the possible failures in our update function. Speaking of update functions...\n\nNote: If you are wondering why init is a function (and why we are ignoring the argument) we will talk about it in the upcoming chapter on JavaScript interop! (Preview: the argument lets us get information from JS on initialization.)\n\nupdate\nOur update function is returning a bit more information as well:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        GotText result ->\n            case result of\n                Ok fullText ->\n                    ( Success fullText, Cmd.none )\n\n                Err _ ->\n                    ( Failure, Cmd.none )\n\nLooking at the type signature, we see that we are not just returning an updated model. We are also producing a command of what we want Elm to do.\nMoving on to the implementation, we pattern match on messages like normal. When a GotText message comes in, we inspect the Result of our HTTP request and update our model depending on whether it was a success or failure. The new part is that we also provide a command.\nSo in the case that we got the full text successfully, we say Cmd.none to indicate that there is no more work to do. We already got the full text!\nAnd in the case that there was some error, we also say Cmd.none and just give up. The text of the book did not load. If we wanted to get fancier, we could pattern match on the Http.Error and retry the request if we got a timeout or something.\nThe point here is that however we decide to update our model, we are also free to issue new commands. I need more data! I want a random number! Etc.\nsubscription\nThe other new thing in this program is the subscription function. It lets you look at the Model and decide if you want to subscribe to certain information. In our example, we say Sub.none to indicate that we do not need to subscribe to anything, but we will soon see an example of a clock where we want to subscribe to the current time!\nSummary\nWhen we create a program with Browser.element, we set up a system like this:\n\nWe get the ability to issue commands from init and update. This allows us to do things like make HTTP requests whenever we want. We also get the ability to subscribe to interesting information. (We will see an example of subscriptions later!)\n"},"effects/json.html":{"url":"effects/json.html","title":"JSON","keywords":"","body":"JSON\nWe just saw an example that uses HTTP to get the content of a book.

Whatever happens there, we do not have any additional commands. It also handles the MorePlease message when someone presses the button, issuing a command to get more random quotes.\nview shows you the quotes!\n\nThe main difference is in the getRandomCatGif definition. Instead of using Http.expectString, we have switched to Http.expectJson. What is the deal with that?\nJSON\nWhen you ask /api/random-quotes for a random quote, the server produces a string of JSON like this:\n{\n  \"quote\": \"December used to be a month but it is now a year\",\n  \"source\": \"Letters from a Stoic\",\n  \"author\": \"Seneca\",\n  \"year\": 54\n}\n\nWe have no guarantees about any of the information here. The server can change the names of fields, and the fields may have different types in different situations. It is a wild world!\nIn JavaScript, the approach is to just turn JSON into JavaScript objects and hope nothing goes wrong. But if there is some typo or unexpected data, you get a runtime exception somewhere in your code. Was the code wrong? Was the data wrong? It is time to start digging around to find out!\nIn Elm, we validate the JSON before it comes into our program. So if the data has an unexpected structure, we learn about it immediately. There is no way for bad data to sneak through and cause a runtime exception three files over. This is accomplished with JSON decoders.\nJSON Decoders\nSay we have some JSON:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Tom\",\n  \"age\": 42\n}\n\nWe need to run it through a Decoder to access specific information. So if we wanted to get the \"age\", we would run the JSON through a Decoder Int that describes exactly how to access that information:\n\nIf all goes well, we get an Int on the other side! And if we wanted the \"name\" we would run the JSON through a Decoder String that describes exactly how to access it:\n\nIf all goes well, we get a String on the other side!\nHow do we create decoders like this though?\nBuilding Blocks\nThe elm/json package gives us the Json.Decode module. It is filled with tiny decoders that we can snap together.\nSo to get \"age\" from { \"name\": \"Tom\", \"age\": 42 } we would create a decoder like this:\nimport Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, int)\n\n\nageDecoder : Decoder Int\nageDecoder =\n    field \"age\" int\n\n\n\n-- int : Decoder Int\n-- field : String -> Decoder a -> Decoder a\n\nThe field function takes two arguments:\n\nString — a field name. So we are demanding an object with an \"age\" field.\nDecoder a — a decoder to try next. So if the \"age\" field exists, we will try this decoder on the value there.\n\nSo putting it together, field \"age\" int is asking for an \"age\" field, and if it exists, it runs the Decoder Int to try to extract an integer.\nWe do pretty much exactly the same thing to extract the \"name\" field:\nimport Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, string)\n\n\nnameDecoder : Decoder String\nnameDecoder =\n    field \"name\" string\n\n\n\n-- string : Decoder String\n\nIn this case we demand an object with a \"name\" field, and if it exists, we want the value there to be a String.\nCombining Decoders\nBut what if we want to decode two fields? We snap decoders together with map2:\nmap2 : (a -> b -> value) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b -> Decoder value\n\nThis function takes in two decoders. It tries them both and combines their results. So now we can put together two different decoders:\nimport Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, map2, field, string, int)\n\ntype alias Person =\n  { name : String\n  , age : Int\n  }\n\npersonDecoder : Decoder Person\npersonDecoder =\n  map2 Person\n      (field \"name\" string)\n      (field \"age\" int)\n\nSo if we used personDecoder on { \"name\": \"Tom\", \"age\": 42 } we would get out an Elm value like Person \"Tom\" 42.\nIf we really wanted to get into the spirit of decoders, we would define personDecoder as map2 Person nameDecoder ageDecoder using our previous definitions. You always want to be building your decoders up from smaller building blocks!\nNesting Decoders\nA lot of JSON data is not so nice and flat. Imagine if /api/random-quotes/v2 was released with richer information about authors:\n{\n  \"quote\": \"December used to be a month but it is now a year\",\n  \"source\": \"Letters from a Stoic\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"Seneca\",\n    \"age\": 68,\n    \"origin\": \"Cordoba\"\n  },\n  \"year\": 54\n}\n\nWe could handle this new scenario by nesting our nice little decoders:\nimport Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, int, map2, map4, string)\n\n\ntype alias Quote =\n    { quote : String\n    , source : String\n    , author : Person\n    , year : Int\n    }\n\n\nquoteDecoder : Decoder Quote\nquoteDecoder =\n    map4 Quote\n        (field \"quote\" string)\n        (field \"source\" string)\n        (field \"author\" personDecoder)\n        (field \"year\" int)\n\n\ntype alias Person =\n    { name : String\n    , age : Int\n    }\n\n\npersonDecoder : Decoder Person\npersonDecoder =\n    map2 Person\n        (field \"name\" string)\n        (field \"age\" int)\n\nNotice that we do not bother decoding the \"origin\" field of the author. Decoders are fine with skipping over fields, which can be helpful when extracting a small amount of information from very large JSON values.\nNext Steps\nThere are a bunch of important functions in Json.Decode that we did not cover here:\n\nbool : Decoder Bool\nlist : Decoder a -> Decoder (List a)\ndict : Decoder a -> Decoder (Dict String a)\noneOf : List (Decoder a) -> Decoder a\n\nSo there are ways to extract all sorts of data structures. The oneOf function is particularly helpful for messy JSON. (e.g. sometimes you get an Int and other times you get a String containing digits. So annoying!)\nWe saw map2 and map4 for handling objects with many fields. But as you start working with larger and larger JSON objects, it is worth checking out NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline. The types there are a bit fancier, but some folks find them much easier to read and work with.\n\nFun Fact: I have heard a bunch of stories of folks finding bugs in their server code as they switched from JS to Elm. The decoders people write end up working as a validation phase, catching weird stuff in JSON values. So when NoRedInk switched from React to Elm, it revealed a couple bugs in their Ruby code!\n\n"},"effects/random.html":{"url":"effects/random.html","title":"Random","keywords":"","body":"Random\nSo far we have only seen commands to make HTTP requests, but we can command other things as well, like generating random values!

The Random module in particular.\nThe core idea is that we have random Generator that describes how to generate a random value. For example:\nimport Random\n\n\nprobability : Random.Generator Float\nprobability =\n    Random.float 0 1\n\n\nroll : Random.Generator Int\nroll =\n    Random.int 1 6\n\n\nusuallyTrue : Random.Generator Bool\nusuallyTrue =\n    Random.weighted ( 80, True ) [ ( 20, False ) ]\n\nSo here we have three random generators. The roll generator is saying it will produce an Int, and more specifically, it will produce an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive. Likewise, the usuallyTrue generator is saying it will produce a Bool, and more specifically, it will be true 80% of the time.\nThe point is that we are not actually generating the values yet. We are just describing how to generate them. From there you use the Random.generate to turn it into a command:\ngenerate : (a -> msg) -> Generator a -> Cmd msg\n\nWhen the command is performed, the Generator produces some value, and then that gets turned into a message for your update function. So in our example, the Generator produces a value between 1 and 6, and then it gets turned into a message like NewFace 1 or NewFace 4. That is all we need to know to get our random dice rolls, but generators can do quite a bit more!\nCombining Generators\nOnce we have some simple generators like probability and usuallyTrue, we can start snapping them together with functions like map3. Imagine we want to make a simple slot machine. We could create a generator like this:\nimport Random\n\n\ntype Symbol\n    = Cherry\n    | Seven\n    | Bar\n    | Grapes\n\n\nsymbol : Random.Generator Symbol\nsymbol =\n    Random.uniform Cherry [ Seven, Bar, Grapes ]\n\n\ntype alias Spin =\n    { one : Symbol\n    , two : Symbol\n    , three : Symbol\n    }\n\n\nspin : Random.Generator Spin\nspin =\n    Random.map3 Spin symbol symbol symbol\n\nWe first create Symbol to describe the pictures that can appear on the slot machine. We then create a random generator that generates each symbol with equal probability.\nFrom there we use map3 to combine them into a new spin generator. It says to generate three symbols and then put them together into a Spin.\nThe point here is that from small building blocks, we can create a Generator that describes pretty complex behavior. And then from our application, we just have to say something like Random.generate NewSpin spin to get the next random value.\n\nExercises: Here are a few ideas to make the example code on this page a bit more interesting!\n\nInstead of showing a number, show the die face as an image.\nInstead of showing an image of a die face, use elm/svg to draw it yourself.\nCreate a weighted die with Random.weighted.\nAdd a second die and have them both roll at the same time.\nHave the dice flip around randomly before they settle on a final value.\n\n\n"},"effects/time.html":{"url":"effects/time.html","title":"Time","keywords":"","body":"Time\nNow we are going to make a digital clock.

Let’s go through these parts!\nTime.Posix and Time.Zone\nTo work with time successfully in programming, we need three different concepts:\n\nHuman Time — This is what you see on clocks (8am) or on calendars (May 3rd). Great! But if my phone call is at 8am in Boston, what time is it for my friend in Vancouver? If it is at 8am in Tokyo, is that even the same day in New York? (No!) So between time zones based on ever-changing political boundaries and inconsistent use of daylight saving time, human time should basically never be stored in your Model or database! It is only for display!\n\nPOSIX Time — With POSIX time, it does not matter where you live or what time of year it is. It is just the number of seconds elapsed since some arbitrary moment (in 1970). Everywhere you go on Earth, POSIX time is the same.\n\nTime Zones — A “time zone” is a bunch of data that allows you to turn POSIX time into human time. This is not just UTC-7 or UTC+3 though! Time zones are way more complicated than a simple offset! Every time Florida switches to DST forever or Samoa switches from UTC-11 to UTC+13, some poor soul adds a note to the IANA time zone database. That database is loaded onto every computer, and between POSIX time and all the corner cases in the database, we can figure out human times!\n\n\nSo to show a human being a time, you must always know Time.Posix and Time.Zone. That is it! So all that “human time” stuff is for the view function, not the Model. In fact, you can see that in our view:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    let\n        hour =\n            String.fromInt (Time.toHour model.zone model.time)\n\n        minute =\n            String.fromInt (Time.toMinute model.zone model.time)\n\n        second =\n            String.fromInt (Time.toSecond model.zone model.time)\n    in\n    h1 [] [ text (hour ++ \":\" ++ minute ++ \":\" ++ second) ]\n\nThe Time.toHour function takes Time.Zone and Time.Posix gives us back an Int from 0 to 23 indicating what hour it is in your time zone.\nThere is a lot more info about handling times in the README of elm/time. Definitely read it before doing more with time! Especially if you are working with scheduling, calendars, etc.\nsubscriptions\nOkay, well how should we get our Time.Posix though? With a subscription!\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions model =\n    Time.every 1000 Tick\n\nWe are using the Time.every function:\nevery : Float -> (Time.Posix -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\nIt takes two arguments:\n\nA time interval in milliseconds. We said 1000 which means every second. But we could also say 60 * 1000 for every minute, or 5 * 60 * 1000 for every five minutes.\nA function that turns the current time into a Msg. So every second, the current time is going to turn into a Tick  for our update function.\n\nThat is the basic pattern of any subscription. You give some configuration, and you describe how to produce Msg values. Not too bad!\nTask.perform\nGetting Time.Zone is a bit trickier.

Here are the install links:\n\nMac - installer\nLinux - instructions\nWindows - installer\n\nAfter installation is complete, open up the terminal on your computer. It may be called cmd.exe or Command Prompt on Windows.\n\nStart by navigating to your desktop in the terminal:\n# Mac and Linux\ncd ~/Desktop\n\n# Windows (but with  filled in with your user name)\ncd C:\\Users\\\\Desktop\n\nThe next step is to get familiar with elm command. I personally had a really hard time learning terminal commands, so I worked hard to make the elm command nice to use. Let's go through a couple common scenarios.\n\nelm init\nYou can start an Elm project by running:\nelm init\n\nTry running this command to create an elm.json file and a src/ directory:\n\nelm.json describes your project.\nsrc/ holds all of your Elm files.\n\nNow try creating a file called src/Main.elm in your editor, and copying in the code from the buttons example.\n\nelm reactor\nelm reactor helps you build Elm projects without messing with the terminal too much. You just run it at the root of your project, like this:\nelm reactor\n\nThis starts a server at http://localhost:8000. You can navigate to any Elm file and see what it looks like. Run elm reactor, follow the localhost link, and try to check out your src/Main.elm file!\n\nelm make\nYou can compile Elm code to HTML or JavaScript with commands like this:\n# Create an index.html file that you can open in your browser.\nelm make src/Main.elm\n\n# Create an optimized JS file to embed in a custom HTML document.\nelm make src/Main.elm --optimize --output=elm.js\n\nTry running these commands on your src/Main.elm file.\nThis is the most general way to compile Elm code. It is extremely useful once your project becomes too advanced for elm reactor.\nThis command produces the same messages you have been seeing in the online editor and with elm reactor. Years of work has gone into them so far, but please report any unhelpful messages here. I am sure there are ways to improve!\n\nelm install\nElm packages all live at package.elm-lang.org.\nSay you look around and decide you need elm/http and elm/json to make some HTTP requests. You can get them set up in your project with the following commands:\nelm install elm/http\nelm install elm/json\n\nThis adds these dependencies into your elm.json file, making these packages available in your project. That will let you say import Http and use functions like Http.get in your programs.\n\nTips and Tricks\nFirst, do not worry about remembering all this stuff!\nYou can always run elm --help to get a full outline of what elm is capable of.\nYou can also run commands like elm make --help and elm repl --help to get hints about a specific command. This is great if you want to check which flags are available and what they do.\nSecond, do not worry if it takes some time to get comfortable with the terminal in general.\nI have been using it for over a decade now, and I still cannot remember how to compress files, find all Elm files in a directory, etc. I still look a lot of things up!\n\nNow that we have our editor set up and elm available in the terminal, let's get back to learning Elm!\n"},"interop/":{"url":"interop/","title":"JavaScript Interop","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Interop\nBy now we have seen The Elm Architecture, types, commands, subscriptions, and we even have Elm installed locally.\nBut what happens when you need to integrate with JavaScript? Maybe there is a browser API that does not have an equivalent Elm package yet. Maybe you want to embed a JavaScript widget within your Elm app? Etc. This chapter will outline Elm's three interop mechanisms:\n\nFlags\nPorts\nCustom Elements\n\nBefore we get into the three mechanisms, we need to know how to compile Elm programs to JavaScript!\n\nNOTE: If you are evaluating Elm for use at work, I encourage you to make sure these three mechanisms will be able to cover all of your needs. You can get a quick overview of this chapter by looking at these examples. Please ask here if you are not sure about something, and I encourage you to circle back to Elm later if you are not fully confident.\n\nCompiling to JavaScript\nRunning elm make produces HTML files by default. So if you say:\nelm make src/Main.elm\n\nIt produces an index.html file that you can just open and start playing with. If you are getting into JavaScript interop, you want to produce JavaScript files instead:\nelm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js\n\nThis produces a JavaScript file that exposes an Elm.Main.init() function. So once you have main.js you can write your own HTML file that does whatever you want.\nEmbedding in HTML\nHere is the minimal HTML needed to make your main.js appear in a browser:\n\n  \n    \n    Main\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      var app = Elm.Main.init({\n        node: document.getElementById(\"myapp\"),\n      });\n    \n  \n\n\nI want to call attention to the important lines here:\n\n - We have a line to load our compiled main.js file. This is required! If you compile an Elm module called Main, you will get an Elm.Main.init() function available in JavaScript. If you compile an Elm module named Home, you will get an Elm.Home.init() function in JavaScript. Etc.\n\n - We need to do two things here. First, we create a  that we want our Elm program to take over. Maybe it is within a larger application, surrounded by tons of other stuff? That is fine! Second, we have a  to initialize our Elm program. Here we call the Elm.Main.init() function to start our program, passing in the node we want to take over.\n\n\nNow that we know how to embed Elm programs in an HTML document, it is time to start exploring the three interop options: flags, ports, and custom elements!\n\nNote: This is a normal HTML file, so you can put whatever you want in it! Many people load additional JS and CSS files in the . That means it is totally fine to write your CSS by hand or to generate it somehow. Add something like  in your  and you have access to it. (There are some great options for specifying your CSS all within Elm as well, but that is a whole other topic!)\n\n"},"interop/flags.html":{"url":"interop/flags.html","title":"Flags","keywords":"","body":"Flags\nFlags are a way to pass values into Elm on initialization.\nCommon uses are passing in API keys, environment variables, and user data. This can be handy if you generate the HTML dynamically. They can also help us load cached information in this localStorage example.\nFlags in HTML\nThe HTML is basically the same as before, but with an additional flags argument to the Elm.Main.init() function\n\n  \n    \n    Main\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      var app = Elm.Main.init({\n        node: document.getElementById(\"myapp\"),\n        flags: Date.now(),\n      });\n    \n  \n\n\nIn this example we are passing in the current time in milliseconds, but any JS value that can be JSON decoded can be given as a flag.\n\nNote: This additional data is called “flags” because it is kind of like command line flags. You can call elm make src/Main.elm, but you can add some flags like --optimize and --output=main.js to customize its behavior. Same sort of thing.\n\nFlags in Elm\nTo handle flags on the Elm side, you need to modify your init function a bit:\nmodule Main exposing (..)\n\nimport Browser\nimport Html exposing (Html, text)\n\n\n\n-- MAIN\n\n\nmain : Program Int Model Msg\nmain =\n    Browser.element\n        { init = init\n        , view = view\n        , update = update\n        , subscriptions = subscriptions\n        }\n\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\n\ntype alias Model =\n    { currentTime : Int }\n\n\ninit : Int -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit currentTime =\n    ( { currentTime = currentTime }\n    , Cmd.none\n    )\n\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\n\ntype Msg\n    = NoOp\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\nupdate _ model =\n    ( model, Cmd.none )\n\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\n\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    text (String.fromInt model.currentTime)\n\n\n\n-- SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions _ =\n    Sub.none\n\nThe only important here is the init function says it takes an Int argument. This is how Elm code gets immediate access to the flags you pass in from JavaScript. From there, you can put things in your model or run some commands. Whatever you need to do.\nI recommend checking out this localStorage example for a more interesting use of flags!\nVerifying Flags\nBut what happens if init says it takes an Int flag, but someone tries to initialize with Elm.Main.init({ flags: \"haha, what now?\" })?\nElm checks for that sort of thing, making sure the flags are exactly what you expect. Without this check, you could pass in anything, leading to runtime errors in Elm!\nThere are a bunch of types that can be given as flags:\n\nBool\nInt\nFloat\nString\nMaybe\nList\nArray\ntuples\nrecords\nJson.Decode.Value\n\nMany folks always use a Json.Decode.Value because it gives them really precise control. They can write a decoder to handle any weird scenarios in Elm code, recovering from unexpected data in a nice way.\nThe other supported types actually come from before we had figured out a way to do JSON decoders. If you choose to use them, there are some subtleties to be aware of. The following examples show the desired flag type, and then the sub-points show what would happen with a couple different JS values:\n\ninit : Int -> ...\n\n0 => 0\n7 => 7\n3.14 => error\n6.12 => error\n\n\ninit : Maybe Int -> ...\n\nnull => Nothing\n42 => Just 42\n\"hi\" => error\n\n\ninit : { x : Float, y : Float } -> ...\n\n{ x: 3, y: 4, z: 50 } => { x = 3, y = 4 }\n{ x: 3, name: \"Tom\" } => error\n{ x: 360, y: \"why?\" } => error\n\n\ninit : (String, Int) -> ...\n\n[\"Tom\", 42] => (\"Tom\", 42)\n[\"Sue\", 33] => (\"Sue\", 33)\n[\"Bob\", \"4\"] => error\n[\"Joe\", 9, 9] => error\n\n\n\nNote that when one of the conversions goes wrong, you get an error on the JS side! We are taking the “fail fast” policy. Rather than the error making its way through Elm code, it is reported as soon as possible. This is another reason why people like to use Json.Decode.Value for flags. Instead of getting an error in JS, the weird value goes through a decoder, guaranteeing that you implement some sort of fallback behavior.\n"},"interop/ports.html":{"url":"interop/ports.html","title":"Ports","keywords":"","body":"Ports\nPorts allow communication between Elm and JavaScript.\nPorts are probably most commonly used for WebSockets and localStorage. Let's focus on the WebSockets example.\nPorts in JavaScript\nHere we have pretty much the same HTML we have been using on the previous pages, but with a bit of extra JavaScript code in there. We create a connection to wss://echo.websocket.org that just repeats back whatever you send it. You can see in the live example that this lets us make the skeleton of a chat room:\n\n\n  \n    \n    Elm + Websockets\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    // Start the Elm application.\n    var app = Elm.Main.init({\n      node: document.getElementById(\"myapp\"),\n    });\n\n    // Create your WebSocket.\n    var socket = new WebSocket(\"wss://echo.websocket.org\");\n\n    // When a command goes to the `sendMessage` port, we pass the message\n    // along to the WebSocket.\n    app.ports.sendMessage.subscribe(function (message) {\n      socket.send(message);\n    });\n\n    // When a message comes into our WebSocket, we pass the message along\n    // to the `messageReceiver` port.\n    socket.addEventListener(\"message\", function (event) {\n      app.ports.messageReceiver.send(event.data);\n    });\n\n    // If you want to use a JavaScript library to manage your WebSocket\n    // connection, replace the code in JS with the alternate implementation.\n  \n\n\nWe call Elm.Main.init() like in all of our interop examples, but this time we are actually using the resulting app object. We are subscribing to the sendMessage port and we are sending to the messageReceiver port.\nThose correspond to code written on the Elm side.\nPorts in Elm\nCheck out the lines that use the port keyword in the corresponding Elm file. This is how we define the ports that we just saw on the JavaScript side.\nport module Main exposing (..)\n\nimport Browser\nimport Html exposing (..)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Html.Events exposing (..)\nimport Json.Decode as D\n\n\n\n-- MAIN\n\n\nmain : Program () Model Msg\nmain =\n    Browser.element\n        { init = init\n        , view = view\n        , update = update\n        , subscriptions = subscriptions\n        }\n\n\n\n-- PORTS\n\n\nport sendMessage : String -> Cmd msg\n\n\nport messageReceiver : (String -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\n\ntype alias Model =\n    { draft : String\n    , messages : List String\n    }\n\n\ninit : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit flags =\n    ( { draft = \"\", messages = [] }\n    , Cmd.none\n    )\n\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\n\ntype Msg\n    = DraftChanged String\n    | Send\n    | Recv String\n\n\n\n-- Use the `sendMessage` port when someone presses ENTER or clicks\n-- the \"Send\" button.

This makes it possible to define ports in a given module. The compiler gives a hint about this if it is needed, so hopefully no one gets too stuck on that!\nOkay, but what is going on with the port declarations for sendMessage and messageReceiver?\nOutgoing Messages (Cmd)\nThe sendMessage declaration lets us send messages out of Elm.\nport sendMessage : String -> Cmd msg\n\nHere we are declaring that we want to send out String values, but we could send out any of the types that work with flags. We talked about those types on the previous page, and you can check out this localStorage example to see a Json.Encode.Value getting sent out to JavaScript.\nFrom there we can use sendMessage like any other function. If your update function produces a sendMessage \"hello\" command, you will hear about it on the JavaScript side:\napp.ports.sendMessage.subscribe(function (message) {\n  socket.send(message);\n});\n\nThis JavaScript code is subscribed to all of the outgoing messages. You can subscribe multiple functions and unsubscribe functions by reference, but we generally recommend keeping things static.\nWe also recommend sending out richer messages, rather than making lots of individual ports. Maybe that means having a custom type in Elm that represents everything you might need to tell JS, and then using Json.Encode to send it out to a single JS subscription. Many people find that this creates a cleaner separation of concerns. The Elm code clearly owns some state, and the JS clearly owns other state.\nIncoming Messages (Sub)\nThe messageReceiver declaration lets us listen for messages coming in to Elm.\nport messageReceiver : (String -> msg) -> Sub msg\n\nWe are saying we are going to receive String values, but again, we can listen for any type that can come in through flags or outgoing ports. Just swap out the String type with one of the types that can cross the border.\nAgain we can use messageReceiver like any other function. In our case we call messageReceiver Recv when defining our subscriptions because we want to hear about any incoming messages from JavaScript. This will let us get messages like Recv \"how are you?\" in our update function.\nOn the JavaScript side, we are able to send things to this port whenever we want:\nsocket.addEventListener(\"message\", function (event) {\n  app.ports.messageReceiver.send(event.data);\n});\n\nWe happen to be sending whenever the websocket gets a message, but you could send at other times as well. Maybe we are getting messages from another data source as well. That is fine, and Elm does not need to know anything about it! Just send the strings through the relevant port.\nNotes\nPorts are about creating strong boundaries! Definitely do not try to make a port for every JS function you need. You may really like Elm and want to do everything in Elm no matter the cost, but ports are not designed for that. Instead, focus on questions like “who owns the state?” and use one or two ports to send messages back and forth. If you are in a complex scenario, you can even simulate Msg values by sending JS like { tag: \"active-users-changed\", list: ... } where you have a tag for all the variants of information you might send across.\nHere are some simple guidelines and common pitfalls:\n\nSending Json.Encode.Value through ports is recommended. Like with flags, certain core types can pass through ports as well. This is from the time before JSON decoders, and you can read about it more here.\n\nAll port declarations must appear in a port module. It is probably best to organize all your ports into one port module so it is easier to see the interface all in one place.\n\nPorts are for applications. A port module is available in applications, but not in packages. This ensures that application authors have the flexibility they need, but the package ecosystem is entirely written in Elm. We think this will create a stronger ecosystem and community in the long run, and we get into the tradeoffs in depth in the upcoming section on the limits of Elm/JS interop.\n\nPorts can be dead code eliminated. Elm has quite aggressive dead code elimination, and it will remove ports that are not used within Elm code. The compiler does not know what goes on in JavaScript, so try to hook things up in Elm before JavaScript.\n\n\nI hope this information will help you find ways to embed Elm in your existing JavaScript! It is not as glamorous as doing a full-rewrite in Elm, but history has shown that it is a much more effective strategy.\n"},"interop/limits.html":{"url":"interop/limits.html","title":"Limits","keywords":"","body":"The Limits of Elm/JS Interop\nMany languages have a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that allows direct bindings functions in the host language. For example, Scala can call Java functions directly. Same with Clojure/Java, Python/C, Haskell/C, and many others.\nElm does not have a traditional Foreign Function Interface with JavaScript. It is not possible to call arbitrary JavaScript functions at any time. This has tradeoffs that some people really love, but it is not for everyone! If you are evaluating Elm for commercial use, I highly encourage you to look through these interop examples to get a feeling for whether flags, ports, and custom elements can cover everything you need.\nWhy does Elm make a different choice than other languages on this?\nTradeoffs\nPorts are somewhat of an outlier in the history of languages. There are two common interop strategies, and Elm did neither of them:\n\nFull backwards compatibility. For example, C++ is a superset of C, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This is the most permissive approach, and it has proven extremely effective. By definition, everyone is using your language already.\nForeign function interface (FFI) This allows direct bindings to functions in the host language. For example, Scala can call Java functions directly. Same with Clojure/Java, Python/C, Haskell/C, and many others. Again, this has proven quite effective.\n\nThese paths are attractive for faster adoption and greater flexibility, but they are not ideal for Elm for two main reasons:\n\nLosing Guarantees. One of the best things about Elm is that there are entire categories of problems you just do not have to worry about. There are no surprise exceptions to catch, and functions cannot mutate data in surprising ways. I think this is the core value of Elm over alternative languages, but if we can call JS directly, all that goes away. Does this package produce runtime exceptions? When? Will it mutate the values I give to it? Do I need to detect that? Does the package have side-effects? Will it send messages to some 3rd party servers? Log passwords? A decent chunk of Elm users are drawn to the language specifically because they do not have to think like that anymore.\nPackage Flooding. There is quite high demand to directly copy JavaScript APIs into Elm. In the two years before elm/html existed, I am sure someone would have contributed jQuery bindings if it was possible. This has already happened in the typed functional languages that compile to JS, but have more traditional interop designs. As far as I know, package flooding is somewhat unique to compile-to-JS languages. The pressure is not nearly as high in Python for example, so I think that downside is a product of the unique culture and history of the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\nGiven these pitfalls, ports and custom elements are attractive because they let you get things done in JavaScript while preserving the best parts of Elm. Great! On the flip side, it means Elm cannot piggyback on the JS ecosystem to gain more libraries more quickly. If you take a longer-view, I think this is actually a key strength. As a result:\n\nPackages are designed for Elm. As members of the Elm community get more experience and confidence, we are starting to see fresh approaches to layout and data visualization that work seamlessly with The Elm Architecture and the overall ecosystem. I expect this to keep happening with other sorts of problems!\nCode is portable. If the compiler someday produces x86 or WebAssembly, the whole ecosystem just keeps working, but faster! Ports guarantee that all packages are written entirely in Elm, and Elm itself was designed such that other non-JS compiler targets are viable.\nPackages are more secure. Languages like JavaScript have serious security concerns with packages. Reports of stealing credentials and stealing API keys are not uncommon, imposing a permanent auditing cost on all packages. Do they add a keylogger to window? Elm packages can guarantee that entire categories of exploits just cannot happen, reducing auditing cost and security risks overall.\nOptimization is easier. The style of generated code has changed significantly from release to release in the past. For example, the 0.19 release was able to dramatically reduce asset size by (1) generating code in a way that works better with JavaScript minifiers and (2) using different runtime representations of custom types depending on your optimization level. I expect it will change again for code slicing or if we find a faster calling convention for currying. Furthermore, the compiler can safely assume that all code is pure, which may allow it to move code around more aggressively than other compilers. Locking into a specific calling convention now is likely to make some of these optimizations impossible.\n\nThis is definitely a longer and harder path, but languages live for 30+ years. They have to support teams and companies for decades, and when I think about what Elm will look like in 20 or 30 years, I think the trade-offs that come with ports look really promising! My talk What is Success? starts a little slow, but it gets into this a bit more!\nAnd again, this path is not for everyone! There are many alternative languages that have a traditional FFI instead, and I encourage you to look into those languages if you think that path might be better. Is the package ecosystem as cohesive? Do you get runtime exceptions more often? Maybe, but maybe the extra flexibility is worth it for you. So I encourage you to take a look at these interop examples to decide if flags, ports, and custom elements will cover everything you need. This is especially important if you are considering Elm for commercial use!\n"},"webapps/":{"url":"webapps/","title":"Web Apps","keywords":"","body":"Web Apps\nSo far we have been creating Elm programs with Browser.element, allowing us to take over a single node in a larger application. This is great for introducing Elm at work (as described here) but what happens after that? How can we use Elm more extensively?\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to create a “web app” with a bunch of different pages that all integrate nicely with each other, but we must start by controlling a single page.\nControl the Document\nThe first step is to switch to starting programs with Browser.document:\ndocument :\n    { init : flags -> ( model, Cmd msg )\n    , view : model -> Document msg\n    , update : msg -> model -> ( model, Cmd msg )\n    , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg\n    }\n    -> Program flags model msg\n\nThe arguments are almost exactly the same as Browser.element, except for the view function. Rather than returning an Html value, you return a Document like this:\ntype alias Document msg =\n    { title : String\n    , body : List (Html msg)\n    }\n\nThis gives you control over the  and the  of the document. Perhaps your program downloads some data and that helps you determine a more specific title. Now you can just change it in your view function!\nServe the Page\nThe compiler produces HTML by default, so you can compile your code like this:\nelm make src/Main.elm\n\nThe output will be a file named index.html that you can serve like any other HTML file. That works fine, but you can get a bit more flexibility by (1) compiling Elm to JavaScript and (2) making your own custom HTML file. To take that path, you compile like this:\nelm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js\n\nThis will produce main.js which you can load from a custom HTML file like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n    Main\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      var app = Elm.Main.init();\n    \n  \n\n\nThis HTML is pretty simple. You load whatever you need in the  and you initialize your Elm program in the . The Elm program will take it from there and render everything.\nEither way, now you have some HTML that you can send to browsers. You can get that HTML to people with free services like GitHub Pages or Netlify, or maybe you make your own server and run a VPS with a service like Digital Ocean. Whatever works for you! You just need a way to get HTML into a browser.\n\nNote 1: Creating custom HTML is helpful if you are doing something custom with CSS. Many people use projects like rtfeldman/elm-css to handle all of their styles from within Elm, but maybe you are working in a team where there is lots of predefined CSS. Maybe the team is even using one of those CSS preprocessors. That is all fine. Just load the final CSS file in the  of your HTML file.\nNote 2: The Digital Ocean link above is a referral link, so if you sign up through that and end up using the service, we get a $25 credit towards our hosting costs for elm-lang.org and package.elm-lang.org.\n\n"},"webapps/navigation.html":{"url":"webapps/navigation.html","title":"Navigation","keywords":"","body":"Navigation\nWe just saw how to serve one page, but say we are making a website like package.elm-lang.org. It has a bunch of pages (e.g. search, README, docs) that all work differently. How does it do that?\nMultiple Pages\nThe simple way would be to serve a bunch of different HTML files. Going to the home page? Load new HTML. Going to elm/core docs? Load new HTML. Going to elm/json docs? Load new HTML.\nUntil Elm 0.19, that is exactly what the package website did! It works. It is simple. But it has some weaknesses:\n\nBlank Screens. The screen goes white every time you load new HTML. Can we do a nice transition instead?\nRedundant Requests. Each package has a single docs.json file, but it gets loaded each time you visit a module like String or Maybe. Can we share the data between pages somehow?\nRedundant Code. The home page and the docs share a lot of functions, like Html.text and Html.div. Can this code be shared between pages?\n\nWe can improve all three cases! The basic idea is to only load HTML once, and then be a bit tricky to handle URL changes.\nSingle Page\nInstead of creating our program with Browser.element or Browser.document, we can create a Browser.application to avoid loading new HTML when the URL changes:\napplication :\n    { init : flags -> Url -> Key -> ( model, Cmd msg )\n    , view : model -> Document msg\n    , update : msg -> model -> ( model, Cmd msg )\n    , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg\n    , onUrlRequest : UrlRequest -> msg\n    , onUrlChange : Url -> msg\n    }\n    -> Program flags model msg\n\nIt extends the functionality of Browser.document in three important scenarios.\nWhen the application starts, init gets the current Url from the browsers navigation bar. This allows you to show different things depending on the Url.\nWhen someone clicks a link, like Home, it is intercepted as a UrlRequest. So instead of loading new HTML with all the downsides, onUrlRequest creates a message for your update where you can decide exactly what to do next. You can save scroll position, persist data, change the URL yourself, etc.\nWhen the URL changes, the new Url is sent to onUrlChange.\nThe resulting message goes to update where you can decide how to show the new page.\nSo rather than loading new HTML, these three additions give you full control over URL changes. Let’s see it in action!\nExample\nWe will start with the baseline Browser.application program. It just keeps track of the current URL. Skim through the code now! Pretty much all of the new and interesting stuff happens in the update function, and we will get into those details after the code:\nimport Browser\nimport Browser.Navigation as Nav\nimport Html exposing (..)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (..)\nimport Url\n\n\n\n-- MAIN\n\n\nmain : Program () Model Msg\nmain =\n    Browser.application\n        { init = init\n        , view = view\n        , update = update\n        , subscriptions = subscriptions\n        , onUrlChange = UrlChanged\n        , onUrlRequest = LinkClicked\n        }\n\n\n\n-- MODEL\n\n\ntype alias Model =\n    { key : Nav.Key\n    , url : Url.Url\n    }\n\n\ninit : () -> Url.Url -> Nav.Key -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit flags url key =\n    ( Model key url, Cmd.none )\n\n\n\n-- UPDATE\n\n\ntype Msg\n    = LinkClicked Browser.UrlRequest\n    | UrlChanged Url.Url\n\n\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        LinkClicked urlRequest ->\n            case urlRequest of\n                Browser.Internal url ->\n                    ( model, Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url) )\n\n                Browser.External href ->\n                    ( model, Nav.load href )\n\n        UrlChanged url ->\n            ( { model | url = url }\n            , Cmd.none\n            )\n\n\n\n-- SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n\nsubscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg\nsubscriptions _ =\n    Sub.none\n\n\n\n-- VIEW\n\n\nview : Model -> Browser.Document Msg\nview model =\n    { title = \"URL Interceptor\"\n    , body =\n        [ text \"The current URL is: \"\n        , b [] [ text (Url.toString model.url) ]\n        , ul []\n            [ viewLink \"/home\"\n            , viewLink \"/profile\"\n            , viewLink \"/reviews/the-century-of-the-self\"\n            , viewLink \"/reviews/public-opinion\"\n            , viewLink \"/reviews/shah-of-shahs\"\n            ]\n        ]\n    }\n\n\nviewLink : String -> Html msg\nviewLink path =\n    li [] [ a [ href path ] [ text path ] ]\n\nThe update function can handle either LinkClicked or UrlChanged messages. There is a lot of new stuff in the LinkClicked branch, so we will focus on that first!\nUrlRequest\nWhenever someone clicks a link like /home, it produces a UrlRequest value:\ntype UrlRequest\n    = Internal Url.Url\n    | External String\n\nThe Internal variant is for any link that stays on the same domain. So if you are browsing https://example.com, internal links include things like settings#privacy, /home, https://example.com/home, and //example.com/home.\nThe External variant is for any link that goes to a different domain. Links like https://elm-lang.org/examples, https://static.example.com, and http://example.com/home all go to a different domain. Notice that changing the protocol from https to http is considered a different domain!\nWhichever link someone presses, our example program is going to create a LinkClicked message and send it to the update function. That is where we see most of the interesting new code!\nLinkClicked\nMost of our update logic is deciding what to do with these UrlRequest values:\nupdate : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        LinkClicked urlRequest ->\n            case urlRequest of\n                Browser.Internal url ->\n                    ( model, Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url) )\n\n                Browser.External href ->\n                    ( model, Nav.load href )\n\n        UrlChanged url ->\n            ( { model | url = url }\n            , Cmd.none\n            )\n\nThe particularly interesting functions are Nav.load and Nav.pushUrl. These are both from the Browser.Navigation module which is all about changing the URL in different ways. We are using the two most common functions from that module:\n\nload loads all new HTML. It is equivalent to typing the URL into the URL bar and pressing enter. So whatever is happening in your Model will be thrown out, and a whole new page is loaded.\npushUrl changes the URL, but does not load new HTML. Instead it triggers a UrlChanged message that we handle ourselves! It also adds an entry to the “browser history” so things work normal when people press the BACK or FORWARD buttons.\n\nSo looking back at the update function, we can understand how it all fits together a bit better now. When the user clicks a https://elm-lang.org link, we get an External message and use load to load new HTML from those servers. But when the user clicks a /home link, we get an Internal message and use pushUrl to change the URL without loading new HTML!\n\nNote 1: Both Internal and External links are producing commands immediately in our example, but that is not required! When someone clicks an External link, maybe you want to save textbox content to your database before navigating away. Or when someone clicks an Internal link, maybe you want to use getViewport to save the scroll position in case they navigate BACK later. That is all possible! It is a normal update function, and you can delay the navigation and do whatever you want.\nNote 2: If you want to restore “what they were looking at” when they come BACK, scroll position is not perfect. If they resize their browser or reorient their device, it could be off by quite a lot! So it is probably better to save “what they were looking at” instead. Maybe that means using getViewportOf to figure out exactly what is on screen at the moment. The particulars depend on how your application works exactly, so I cannot give exact advice!\n\nUrlChanged\nThere are a couple ways to get UrlChanged messages. We just saw that pushUrl produces them, but pressing the browser BACK and FORWARD buttons produce them as well. And like I was saying in the notes a second ago, when you get a LinkClicked message, the pushUrl command may not be given immediately.\nSo the nice thing about having a separate UrlChanged message is that it does not matter how or when the URL changed. All you need to know is that it did!\nWe are just storing the new URL in our example here, but in a real web app, you need to parse the URL to figure out what content to show. That is what the next page is all about!\n\nNote: I skipped talking about Nav.Key to try to focus on more important concepts. But I will explain here for those who are interested!\nA navigation Key is needed to create navigation commands (like pushUrl) that change the URL. You only get access to a Key when you create your program with Browser.application, guaranteeing that your program is equipped to detect these URL changes. If Key values were available in other kinds of programs, unsuspecting programmers would be sure to run into some annoying bugs and learn a bunch of techniques the hard way!\nAs a result of all that, we have a line in our Model for our Key. A relatively low price to pay to help everyone avoid an extremely subtle category of problems!\n\n"},"webapps/url_parsing.html":{"url":"webapps/url_parsing.html","title":"URL Parsing","keywords":"","body":"Parsing URLs\nIn a realistic web app, we want to show different content for different URLs:\n\n/search\n/search?q=seiza\n/settings\n\nHow do we do that? We use the elm/url to parse the raw strings into nice Elm data structures. This package makes the most sense when you just look at examples, so that is what we will do!\nExample 1\nSay we have an art website where the following addresses should be valid:\n\n/topic/architecture\n/topic/painting\n/topic/sculpture\n/blog/42\n/blog/123\n/blog/451\n/user/tom\n/user/sue\n/user/sue/comment/11\n/user/sue/comment/51\n\nSo we have topic pages, blog posts, user information, and a way to look up individual user comments. We would use the Url.Parser module to write a URL parser like this:\nimport Url.Parser exposing ((), Parser, int, map, oneOf, s, string)\n\n\ntype Route\n    = Topic String\n    | Blog Int\n    | User String\n    | Comment String Int\n\n\nrouteParser : Parser (Route -> a) a\nrouteParser =\n    oneOf\n        [ map Topic (s \"topic\"  string)\n        , map Blog (s \"blog\"  int)\n        , map User (s \"user\"  string)\n        , map Comment (s \"user\"  string  s \"comment\"  int)\n        ]\n\n\n\n-- /topic/pottery        ==>  Just (Topic \"pottery\")\n-- /topic/collage        ==>  Just (Topic \"collage\")\n-- /topic/               ==>  Nothing\n-- /blog/42              ==>  Just (Blog 42)\n-- /blog/123             ==>  Just (Blog 123)\n-- /blog/mosaic          ==>  Nothing\n-- /user/tom/            ==>  Just (User \"tom\")\n-- /user/sue/            ==>  Just (User \"sue\")\n-- /user/bob/comment/42  ==>  Just (Comment \"bob\" 42)\n-- /user/sam/comment/35  ==>  Just (Comment \"sam\" 35)\n-- /user/sam/comment/    ==>  Nothing\n-- /user/                ==>  Nothing\n\nThe Url.Parser module makes it quite concise to fully turn valid URLs into nice Elm data!\nExample 2\nNow say we have a personal blog where addresses like this are valid:\n\n/blog/12/the-history-of-chairs\n/blog/13/the-endless-september\n/blog/14/whale-facts\n/blog/\n/blog?q=whales\n/blog?q=seiza\n\nIn this case we have individual blog posts and a blog overview with an optional query parameter. We need to add the Url.Parser.Query module to write our URL parser this time:\nimport Url.Parser exposing ((), (), Parser, int, map, oneOf, s, string)\nimport Url.Parser.Query as Query\n\n\ntype Route\n    = BlogPost Int String\n    | BlogQuery (Maybe String)\n\n\nrouteParser : Parser (Route -> a) a\nrouteParser =\n    oneOf\n        [ map BlogPost (s \"blog\"  int  string)\n        , map BlogQuery (s \"blog\"  Query.string \"q\")\n        ]\n\n\n\n-- /blog/14/whale-facts  ==>  Just (BlogPost 14 \"whale-facts\")\n-- /blog/14              ==>  Nothing\n-- /blog/whale-facts     ==>  Nothing\n-- /blog/                ==>  Just (BlogQuery Nothing)\n-- /blog                 ==>  Just (BlogQuery Nothing)\n-- /blog?q=chabudai      ==>  Just (BlogQuery (Just \"chabudai\"))\n-- /blog/?q=whales       ==>  Just (BlogQuery (Just \"whales\"))\n-- /blog/?query=whales   ==>  Just (BlogQuery Nothing)\n\nThe  and  operators let us write parsers that look quite like the actual URLs we want to parse. And adding Url.Parser.Query allowed us to handle query parameters like ?q=seiza.\nExample 3\nOkay, now we have a documentation website with addresses like this:\n\n/Basics\n/Maybe\n/List\n/List#map\n/List#filter\n/List#foldl\n\nWe can use the fragment parser from Url.Parser to handle these addresses like this:\ntype alias Docs =\n    ( String, Maybe String )\n\n\ndocsParser : Parser (Docs -> a) a\ndocsParser =\n    map Tuple.pair (string  fragment identity)\n\n\n\n-- /Basics     ==>  Just (\"Basics\", Nothing)\n-- /Maybe      ==>  Just (\"Maybe\", Nothing)\n-- /List       ==>  Just (\"List\", Nothing)\n-- /List#map   ==>  Just (\"List\", Just \"map\")\n-- /List#      ==>  Just (\"List\", Just \"\")\n-- /List/map   ==>  Nothing\n-- /           ==>  Nothing\n\nSo now we can handle URL fragments as well!\nSynthesis\nNow that we have seen a few parsers, we should look at how this fits into a Browser.application program. Rather than just saving the current URL like last time, can we parse it into useful data and show that instead?\nTODO\n\nThe major new things are:\n\nOur update parses the URL when it gets a UrlChanged message.\nOur view function shows different content for different addresses!\n\nIt is really not too fancy. Nice!\nBut what happens when you have 10 or 20 or 100 different pages? Does it all go in this one view function? Surely it cannot be all in one file. How many files should it be in? What should be the directory structure? That is what we will discuss next!\n"},"webapps/modules.html":{"url":"webapps/modules.html","title":"Modules","keywords":"","body":"Modules\nElm has modules to help you grow your codebase in a nice way. On the most basic level, modules let you break your code into multiple files.\nDefining Modules\nElm modules work best when you define them around a central type. Like how the List module is all about the List type. So say we want to build a module around a Post type for a blogging website. We can create something like this:\nmodule Post exposing (Post, decoder, encode, estimatedReadTime)\n\nimport Json.Decode as D\nimport Json.Encode as E\n\n\n\n-- POST\n\n\ntype alias Post =\n    { title : String\n    , author : String\n    , content : String\n    }\n\n\n\n-- READ TIME\n\n\nestimatedReadTime : Post -> Float\nestimatedReadTime post =\n    toFloat (wordCount post) / 220\n\n\nwordCount : Post -> Int\nwordCount post =\n    List.length (String.words post.content)\n\n\n\n-- JSON\n\n\nencode : Post -> E.Value\nencode post =\n    E.object\n        [ ( \"title\", E.string post.title )\n        , ( \"author\", E.string post.author )\n        , ( \"content\", E.string post.content )\n        ]\n\n\ndecoder : D.Decoder Post\ndecoder =\n    D.map3 Post\n        (D.field \"title\" D.string)\n        (D.field \"author\" D.string)\n        (D.field \"content\" D.string)\n\nThe only new syntax here is that module Post exposing (..) line at the very top. That means the module is known as Post and only certain values are available to outsiders. As written, the wordCount function is only available within the Post module. Hiding functions like this is one of the most important techniques in Elm!\n\nNote: If you forget to add a module declaration, Elm will use this one instead:\nmodule Main exposing (..)\n\nThis makes things easier for beginners working in just one file. They should not be confronted with the module system on their first day!\n\nGrowing Modules\nAs your application gets more complex, you will end up adding things to your modules. It is normal for Elm modules to be in the 400 to 1000 line range, as I explain in The Life of a File. But when you have multiple modules, how do you decide where to add new code?\nI try to use the following heuristics when code is:\n\nUnique — If logic only appears in one place, I break out top-level helper functions as close to the usage as possible. Maybe use a comment header like -- POST PREVIEW to indicate that the following definitions are related to previewing posts.\nSimilar — Say we want to show Post previews on the home page and on the author pages. On the home page, we want to emphasize the interesting content, so we want longer snippets. But on the author page, we want to emphasize the breadth of content, so we want to focus on titles. These cases are similar, not the same, so we go back to the unique heuristic. Just write the logic separately.\nThe Same — At some point we will have a bunch of unique code. That is fine! But perhaps we find that some definitions contain logic that is exactly the same. Break out a helper function for that logic! If all the uses are in one module, no need to do anything more. Maybe put a comment header like -- READ TIME if you really want.\n\nThese heuristics are all about making helper functions within a single file. You only want to create a new module when a bunch of these helper functions all center around a specific custom type. For example, you start by creating a Page.Author module, and do not create a Post module until the helper functions start piling up. At that point, creating a new module should make your code feel easier to navigate and understand. If it does not, go back to the version that was clearer. More modules is not more better! Take the path that keeps the code simple and clear.\nTo summarize, assume similar code is unique by default. (It usually is in user interfaces in the end!) If you see logic that is the same in different definitions, make some helper functions with appropriate comment headers. When you have a bunch of helper functions about a specific type, consider making a new module. If a new module makes your code clearer, great! If not, go back. More files is not inherently simpler or clearer.\n\nNote: One of the most common ways to get tripped up with modules is when something that was once the same becomes similar later on. Very common, especially in user interfaces! Folks will often try to create a Frankenstein function that handles all the different cases. Adding more arguments. Adding more complex arguments. The better path is to accept that you now have two unique situations and copy the code into both places. Customize it exactly how you need. Then see if any of the resulting logic is the same. If so, move it out into helpers. Your long functions should split into multiple smaller functions, not grow longer and more complex!\n\nUsing Modules\nIt is customary in Elm for all of your code to live in the src/ directory. That is the default for elm.json even. So our Post module would need to live in a file named src/Post.elm. From there, we can import a module and use its exposed values. There are four ways to do that:\n\nimport Post\n-- Post.Post, Post.estimatedReadTime, Post.encode, Post.decoder\n\nimport Post as P\n-- P.Post, P.estimatedReadTime, P.encode, P.decoder\n\nimport Post exposing (Post, estimatedReadTime)\n-- Post, estimatedReadTime\n-- Post.Post, Post.estimatedReadTime, Post.encode, Post.decoder\n\nimport Post as P exposing (Post, estimatedReadTime)\n-- Post, estimatedReadTime\n-- P.Post, P.estimatedReadTime, P.encode, P.decoder\n\n\nI recommend using exposing pretty rarely. Ideally on zero or one of your imports. Otherwise, it can start getting hard to figure out where things came from when reading though. “Wait, where is filterPostBy from again? What arguments does it take?” It gets harder and harder to read through code as you add more exposing. I tend to use it for import Html exposing (..) but not on anything else. For everything else, I recommend using the standard import and maybe using as if you have a particularly long module name!\n"},"webapps/structure.html":{"url":"webapps/structure.html","title":"Structure","keywords":"","body":"Structuring Web Apps\nLike I was saying on the previous page, all modules should be built around a central type. So if I was making a web app for blog posts, I would start with modules like this:\n\nMain\nPage.Home\nPage.Search\nPage.Author\n\nI would have a module for each page, centered around the Model type. Those modules follow The Elm Architecture with the typical Model, init, update, view, and whatever helper functions you need. From there, I would just keep growing those modules longer and longer. Keep adding the types and functions you need. If I ever notice that I created a custom type with a couple helper functions, I might move that out into its own module.\nBefore we see some examples, I want to emphasize an important strategy.\nDo Not Plan Ahead\nNotice that my Page modules do not make any guesses about the future. I do not try to define modules that can be used in multiple places. I do not try to share any functions. This is on purpose!\nEarly in my projects, I always have these grand schemes of how everything will fit together. “The pages for editing and viewing posts both care about posts, so I will have a Post module!” But as I write my application, I find that only the viewing page should have a publication date. And I actually need to track editing differently to cache data when tabs are closed. And they actually need to be stored a bit differently on servers as a result. Etc. I end up turning Post into a big mess to handle all these competing concerns, and it ends up being worse for both pages.\nBy just starting with pages, it becomes much easier to see when things are similar, but not the same. The norm in user interfaces! So with editing and viewing posts, it seems plausible that we could end up with an EditablePost type and a ViewablePost type, each with different structure, helper functions, and JSON decoders. Maybe those types are complex enough to warrant their own module. Maybe not! I would just write the code and see what happens.\nThis works because the compiler makes it really easy to do huge refactors. If I realize I got something majorly wrong across 20 files, I just fix it.\nExamples\nYou can see examples of this structure in the following open-source projects:\n\nelm-spa-example\npackage.elm-lang.org\n\n\nCulture Shock\nFolks coming from JavaScript tend to bring habits, expectations, and anxieties that are specific to JavaScript. They are legitimately important in that context, but they can cause some pretty severe troubles when transferred to Elm.\nDefensive Instincts\nIn The Life of a File I point out some JavaScript Folk Knowledge that leads you astray in Elm:\n\n“Prefer shorter files.” In JavaScript, the longer your file is, the more likely you have some sneaky mutation that will cause a really difficult bug. But in Elm, that is not possible! Your file can be 2000 lines long and that still cannot happen.\n“Get architecture right from the beginning.” In JavaScript, refactoring is extremely risky. In many cases, it is cheaper just to rewrite it from scratch. But in Elm, refactoring is cheap and reliable! You can make changes in 20 different files with confidence.\n\nThese defensive instincts are protecting you from problems that do not exist in Elm. Knowing this in your mind is different than knowing it in your gut though, and I have observed that JS folks often feel deeply uncomfortable when they see files pass the 400 or 600 or 800 line mark. So I encourage you to push your limit on number of lines! See how far you can go. Try using comment headers, try making helper functions, but keep it all in one file. Having this experience yourself is extremely valuable!\nMVC\nSome folks see The Elm Architecture and have the intuition to divide their code into separate modules for Model, Update, and View. Do not do this!\nIt leads to unclear and debatable boundaries. What happens when Post.estimatedReadTime is used in both the update and view functions? Totally reasonable, but it does not clearly belong to one or the other. Maybe you need a Utils module? Maybe it actually is a controller kind of thing? The resulting code tends to be hard to navigate because placing each function is now an ontological question, and all of your colleagues have different theories. What is an estimatedReadTime really? What is its essence? Estimation? What would Richard think is its essence? Time?\nIf you build each module around a type, you rarely run into these kinds of questions. You have a Page.Home module that contains your Model, update, and view. You write helper functions. You add a Post type eventually. You add an estimatedReadTime function. Maybe someday there are a bunch of helpers about that Post type, and maybe it is worth splitting into its own module. With this convention, you end up spending a lot less time considering and reconsidering module boundaries. I find that the code also comes out much clearer.\nComponents\nFolks coming from React expect everything to be components. Actively trying to make components is a recipe for disaster in Elm. The root issue is that components are objects:\n\ncomponents = local state + methods\nlocal state + methods = objects\n\nIt would be odd to start using Elm and wonder \"how do I structure my application with objects?\" There are no objects in Elm! Folks in the community would recommend using custom types and functions instead.\nThinking in terms of components encourages you to create modules based on the visual design of your application. “There is a sidebar, so I need a Sidebar module.” It would be way easier to just make a viewSidebar function and pass it whatever arguments it needs. It probably does not even have any state. Maybe one or two fields? Just put it in the Model you already have. If it really is worth splitting out into its own module, you will know because you will have a custom type with a bunch of relevant helper functions!\nPoint is, writing a viewSidebar function does not mean you need to create a corresponding update and Model to go with it. Resist this instinct. Just write the helper functions you need.\n\n"},"optimization/":{"url":"optimization/","title":"Optimization","keywords":"","body":"Optimization\nThere are two major types of optimization in Elm. Optimizing performance and optimizing asset size:\n\nPerformance — The slowest thing in browsers is the DOM. By a huge margin. I have done a lot of profiling to speed up Elm applications, and most things have no noticeable impact. Using better data structures? Negligible. Caching the results of computations in my model? Negligible and my code is worse now. The only thing that makes a big difference is using Html.Lazy and Html.Keyed to do fewer DOM operations.\n\nAsset Size — Running in browsers means we have to care about download times. The smaller we can get our assets, the faster they load on mobile devices and slow internet connections. This is probably more important than any of the performance optimizations you will do! Fortunately, the Elm compiler does a really good job of making your code as small as possible, so you do not need to do a bunch of work making your code confusing to get decent outcomes here.\n\n\nBoth are important though, so this chapter will go through how this all works!\n"},"optimization/lazy.html":{"url":"optimization/lazy.html","title":"Html.lazy","keywords":"","body":"Html.Lazy\nThe elm/html package is used to show things on screen. To understand how to optimize it, we need to learn how it works in the first place!\nWhat is the DOM?\nIf you are creating an HTML file, you would write HTML directly like this:\n\n  Chair alternatives include:\n  \n    seiza\n    chabudai\n  \n\n\nYou can think of this as producing some DOM data structure behind the scenes:\n\nThe black boxes represent heavy-weight DOM objects with hundreds of attributes. And when any of them change, it can trigger expensive renders and reflows of page content.\nWhat is Virtual DOM?\nIf you are creating an Elm file, you would use elm/html to write something like this:\nviewChairAlts : List String -> Html msg\nviewChairAlts chairAlts =\n    div []\n        [ p [] [ text \"Chair alternatives include:\" ]\n        , ul [] (List.map viewAlt chairAlts)\n        ]\n\n\nviewAlt : String -> Html msg\nviewAlt chairAlt =\n    li [] [ text chairAlt ]\n\nYou can think of viewChairAlts [\"seiza\",\"chabudai\"] as producing some “Virtual DOM” data structure behind the scenes:\n\nThe white boxes represent light-weight JavaScript objects. They only have the attributes you specify. Their creation can never cause renders or reflows. Point is, compared to DOM nodes, these are much cheaper to allocate!\nRender\nIf we are always working with these virtual nodes in Elm, how does it get converted to the DOM we see on screen? When an Elm program starts, it goes like this:\n\nCall init to get the initial Model.\nCall view to get the initial virtual nodes.\n\nNow that we have virtual nodes, we make an exact replica in the real DOM:\n\nGreat! But what about when things change? Redoing the whole DOM on every frame does not work, so what do we do instead?\nDiffing\nOnce we have the initial DOM, we switch to working primarily with virtual nodes instead. Whenever the Model changes, we run view again. From there, we “diff” the resulting virtual nodes to figure out how to touch the DOM as little as possible.\nSo imagine our Model gets a new chair alternative, and we want to add a new li node for it. Behind the scenes, Elm diffs the current virtual nodes and the next virtual nodes to detect any changes:\n\nIt noticed that a third li was added. I marked it in green. Elm now knows exactly how to modify the real DOM to make it match. Just insert that new li:\n\nThis diffing process makes it possible to touch the DOM as little as possible. And if no differences are found, we do not need to touch the DOM at all! So this process helps minimize the renders and reflows that need to happen.\nBut can we do even less work?\nHtml.Lazy\nThe Html.Lazy module makes it possible to not even build the virtual nodes! The core idea is the lazy function:\nlazy : (a -> Html msg) -> a -> Html msg\n\nGoing back to our chair example, we called viewChairAlts [\"seiza\",\"chabudai\"], but we could just as easily have called lazy viewChairAlts [\"seiza\",\"chabudai\"] instead. The lazy version allocates a single “lazy” node like this:\n\nThe node just keeps a reference to the function and arguments. Elm can put the function and arguments together to generate the whole structure if needed, but it is not always needed!\nOne of the cool things about Elm is the “same input, same output” guarantee for functions. So whenever we run into two “lazy” nodes while diffing virtual nodes, we ask is the function the same? Are the arguments the same? If they are all the same, we know the resulting virtual nodes are the same as well! So we can skip building the virtual nodes entirely! If any of them have changed, we can build the virtual nodes and do a normal diff.\n\nNote: When are two values “the same” though? To optimize for performance, we use JavaScript’s === operator behind the scenes:\n\nStructural equality is used for Int, Float, String, Char, and Bool.\nReference equality is used for records, lists, custom types, dictionaries, etc.\n\nStructural equality means that 4 is the same as 4 no matter how you produced those values. Reference equality means the actual pointer in memory has to be the same. Using reference equality is always cheap O(1), even when the data structure has thousands or millions of entries. So this is mostly about making sure that using lazy will never slow your code down a bunch by accident. All the checks are super cheap!\n\nUsage\nThe ideal place to put a lazy node is at the root of your application. Many applications are set up to have distinct visual regions like headers, sidebars, search results, etc. And when people are messing with one, they are very rarely messing with the others. This creates really natural lines for lazy calls!\nFor example, in my TodoMVC implementation, the view is defined like this:\nview : Model -> Html Msg\nview model =\n    div\n        [ class \"todomvc-wrapper\"\n        , style \"visibility\" \"hidden\"\n        ]\n        [ section\n            [ class \"todoapp\" ]\n            [ lazy viewInput model.field\n            , lazy2 viewEntries model.visibility model.entries\n            , lazy2 viewControls model.visibility model.entries\n            ]\n        , infoFooter\n        ]\n\nNotice that the text input, entries, and controls are all in separate lazy nodes. So I can type however many characters I want in the input without ever building virtual nodes for the entries or controls. They are not changing! So the first tip is try to use lazy nodes at the root of your application.\nIt can also be useful to use lazy in long lists of items. In the TodoMVC app, it is all about adding entries to your todo list. You could conceivably have hundreds of entries, but they change very infrequently. This is a great candidate for laziness! By switching viewEntry entry to lazy viewEntry entry we can skip a bunch of allocation that is very rarely useful. So the second tip is try to use lazy nodes on repeated structures where each individual item changes infrequently.\nSummary\nTouching the DOM is way more expensive than anything that happens in a normal user interface. Based on my benchmarking, you can do whatever you want with fancy data structures, but in the end it only matters how much you successfully use lazy.\nOn the next page, we will learn a technique to use lazy even more!\n"},"optimization/keyed.html":{"url":"optimization/keyed.html","title":"Html.keyed","keywords":"","body":"Html.Keyed\nOn the previous page, we learned how Virtual DOM works and how we can use Html.Lazy to avoid a bunch of work. Now we are going to introduce Html.Keyed to skip even more work.\nThis optimization is particularly helpful for lists of data in your interface that must support insertion, removal, and reordering.\nThe Problem\nSay we have a list of all the Presidents of the United States. And maybe it lets us sort by name, by education, by net worth, and by birthplace.\nWhen the diffing algorithm (described on the previous page) gets to a long list of items, it just goes through pairwise:\n\nDiff the current 1st element with the next 1st element.\nDiff the current 2nd element with the next 2nd element.\n...\n\nBut when you change the sort order, all of these are going to be different! So you end up doing a lot of work on the DOM when you could have just shuffled some nodes around.\nThis issue exists with insertion and removal as well. Say you remove the 1st of 100 items. Everything is going to be off-by-one and look different. So you get 99 diffs and one removal at the end. No good!\nThe Solution\nThe fix for all of this is Html.Keyed.node, which makes it possible to pair each entry with a “key” that easily distinguishes it from all the others.\nSo in our presidents example, we could write our code like this:\nimport Html exposing (..)\nimport Html.Keyed as Keyed\nimport Html.Lazy exposing (lazy)\n\nviewPresidents : List President -> Html msg\nviewPresidents presidents =\n  Keyed.node \"ul\" [] (List.map viewKeyedPresident presidents)\n\nviewKeyedPresident : President -> (String, Html msg)\nviewKeyedPresident president =\n  ( president.name, lazy viewPresident president )\n\nviewPresident : President -> Html msg\nviewPresident president =\n  li [] [ ... ]\n\nEach child node is associated with a key. So instead of doing a pairwise diff, we can diff based on matching keys!\nNow the Virtual DOM implementation can recognize when the list is resorted. It first matches all the presidents up by key. Then it diffs those. We used lazy for each entry, so we can skip all that work. Nice! It then figures out how to shuffle the DOM nodes to show things in the order you want. So the keyed version does a lot less work in the end.\nResorting helps show how it works, but it is not the most common case that really needs this optimization. Keyed nodes are extremely important for insertion and removal. When you remove the 1st of 100 elements, using keyed nodes allows the Virtual DOM implementation to recognize that immediately. So you get a single removal instead of 99 diffs.\nSummary\nTouching the DOM is extraordinarily slow compared to the sort of computations that happen in a normal application. Always reach for Html.Lazy and Html.Keyed first. I recommend verifying this with profiling as much as possible. Some browsers provide a timeline view of your program, like this. It gives you a summary of how much time is spent in loading, scripting, rendering, painting, etc. If you see that 10% of the time is spent scripting, you could make your Elm code twice as fast and not make any noticeable difference. Whereas simple additions of lazy and keyed nodes could start taking big chunks out of that other 90% by touching the DOM less!\n"},"optimization/asset_size.html":{"url":"optimization/asset_size.html","title":"Minification","keywords":"","body":"Asset Size\nThe only thing that is slower than touching the DOM is talking to servers. Especially for folks on mobile phones with slow internet. So you can optimize your code all day with Html.Lazy and Html.Keyed, but your application will still feel slow if it loads slowly!\nA great way to improve is to send fewer bits. For example, if a 122kb asset can become a 9kb asset, it will load faster! We get results like that by using the following techniques:\n\nCompilation. The Elm compiler can perform optimizations like dead code elimination and record field renaming. So it can cut unused code and shorten record field names like userStatus in the generated code.\nMinification. In the JavaScript world, there are tools called “minifiers” that do a bunch of transformations. They shorten variables. They inline. They convert if statements to ternary operators. They turn '\\u0041' to 'A'. Anything to save a few bits!\nCompression. Once you have gotten the code as small as possible, you can use a compression algorithm like gzip to shrink it even further. It does particularly well with keywords like function and return that you just cannot get rid of in the code itself.\n\nElm makes it pretty easy to get all this set up for your project. No need for some complex build system. It is just two terminal commands!\nInstructions\nStep one is to compile with the --optimize flag. This does things like shortening record field names.\nStep two is to minify the resulting JavaScript code. I use a minifier called uglifyjs, but you can use a different one if you want. The neat thing about uglifyjs is all its special flags. These flags unlock optimizations that are unreliable in normal JS code, but thanks to the design of Elm, they are totally safe for us!\nPutting those together, we can optimize src/Main.elm with two terminal commands:\nelm make src/Main.elm --optimize --output=elm.js\nuglifyjs elm.js --compress 'pure_funcs=[F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9],pure_getters,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps,unsafe' | uglifyjs --mangle --output elm.min.js\n\nAfter this you will have an elm.js and a smaller elm.min.js file!\n\nNote 1: uglifyjs is called twice there. First to --compress and second to --mangle. This is necessary! Otherwise uglifyjs will ignore our pure_funcs flag.\nNote 2: If the uglifyjs command is not available in your terminal, you can run the command npm install uglify-js --global to download it. If you do not have npm either, you can get it with nodejs.\n\nScripts\nIt is hard to remember all those flags for uglifyjs, so it is probably better to write a script that does this.\nSay we want a bash script that produces elm.js and elm.min.js files. On Mac or Linux, we can define optimize.sh like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nset -e\n\njs=\"elm.js\"\nmin=\"elm.min.js\"\n\nelm make --optimize --output=$js \"$@\"\n\nuglifyjs $js --compress 'pure_funcs=[F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9],pure_getters,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps,unsafe' | uglifyjs --mangle --output $min\n\necho \"Compiled size:$(wc $js -c) bytes  ($js)\"\necho \"Minified size:$(wc $min -c) bytes  ($min)\"\necho \"Gzipped size: $(gzip $min -c | wc -c) bytes\"\n\nNow if I run ./optimize.sh src/Main.elm on my TodoMVC code, I see something like this in the terminal:\nCompiled size:  122297 bytes  (elm.js)\nMinified size:   24123 bytes  (elm.min.js)\nGzipped size:     9148 bytes\nPretty neat! We only need to send about 9kb to get this program to people!\nThe important commands here are elm and uglifyjs which work on any platform, so it should not be too tough to do something similar on Windows.\nAdvice\nI recommend writing a Browser.application and compiling to a single JavaScript file as we have seen here. It will get downloaded (and cached) when people first visit. Elm creates quite small files compared to the popular competitors, as you can see here, so this strategy can take you quite far.\n\nNote: In theory, it is possible to get even smaller assets with Elm. It is not possible right now, but if you are working on 50k lines of Elm or more, we would like to learn about your situation as part of a user study. More details here!\n\n"},"next_steps.html":{"url":"next_steps.html","title":"Next Steps","keywords":"","body":"Next Steps\nWe have a bunch of foundational knowledge now. The next steps are all about gaining experience and building relationships.\nBuild Something\nExperience is a great teacher, so I recommend building an application that interests you. If you do not have something in mind, maybe something like this:\n\nExpand Examples — Take some of the examples from this book and add to them. The code is here! Mess with elm-spa-example.\nSomething from Work — Maybe there is something you do at work, and you want to see how it might work in Elm. Try it out on your own and see how it goes! This will set you up well for the advice in How to Use Elm at Work.\nData Visualization — Use a package like terezka/line-charts to display data that interests you. I would start with some fake data, but maybe work up to trying to showing data from somewhere else. There is a ton of economic and health data available that would benefit from better presentation!\nGames — I got into programming by making games like pong, breakout, and space invaders. Maybe you will like that sort of thing too! Start by drawing stuff with elm/svg. From there, try responding to events like onKeyDown, onMouseMove, and onAnimationFrame. At some point, you can even get into 3D graphics with elm-explorations/webgl!\n\nAsk Questions\nThere are loads of friendly and knowledgeable folks on Slack and Discourse. Whether you just started programming or have 20 years experience in industry, the #beginners channel on Slack is great for people new to programming in Elm! Maybe you have an error message you are stuck on? Maybe you are struggling to understand JSON decoders? Maybe the Task type is tripping you up? Maybe you are curious to get some feedback on a custom type you defined? Whatever the problem, you can always ask for help!\nMeet People\nThere are meetups all over the world. We encourage organizers to run code nights where folks can build projects and relationships. The obvious benefit is that you can get help with whatever you are working on, but you also meet everyone else who is using Elm in town. Maybe someone is working on something cool that inspires you. Maybe you learn a technique you did not know you did not know. Maybe someone has a job opening. Maybe knowing a bunch of local Elm programmers will help your case at work. Maybe it is just a fun time. Programmers tend to undervalue the benefits of these personal relationships, but it is one of the most important parts of a healthy programming language community!\n"},"appendix/types_as_sets.html":{"url":"appendix/types_as_sets.html","title":"Types as Sets","keywords":"","body":"Types as Sets\nWe have seen primitive types like Bool and String. We have made our own custom types like this:\ntype Color\n    = Red\n    | Yellow\n    | Green\n\nOne of the most important techniques in Elm programming is to make the possible values in code exactly match the valid values in real life. This leaves no room for invalid data, and this is why I always encourage folks to focus on custom types and data structures.\nIn pursuit of this goal, I have found it helpful to understand the relationship between types and sets. It sounds like a stretch, but it really helps develop your mindset!\nSets\nYou can think of types as a set of values.\n\nBool is the set { True, False }\nColor is the set { Red, Yellow, Green }\nInt is the set { ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ... }\nFloat is the set { ... 0.9, 0.99, 0.999 ... 1.0 ... }\nString is the set { \"\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\" ... \"hello\" ... }\n\nSo when you say x : Bool it is like saying x is in the { True, False } set.\nCardinality\nSome interesting things happen when you start figuring out how many values are in these sets. For example the Bool set { True, False } contains two values. So math people would say that Bool has a cardinality of two. So conceptually:\n\ncardinality(Bool) = 2\ncardinality(Color) = 3\ncardinality(Int) = ∞\ncardinality(Float) = ∞\ncardinality(String) = ∞\n\nThis gets more interesting when we start thinking about types like (Bool, Bool) that combine sets together.\n\nNote: The cardinality for Int and Float are actually smaller than infinity. Computers need to fit the numbers into a fixed amount of bits (as described here) so it is more like cardinality(Int32) = 2^32 and cardinality(Float32) = 2^32. The point is just that it is a lot.\n\nMultiplication (Tuples and Records)\nWhen you combine types with tuples, the cardinalities get multiplied:\n\ncardinality((Bool, Bool)) = cardinality(Bool) × cardinality(Bool) = 2 × 2 = 4\ncardinality((Bool, Color)) = cardinality(Bool) × cardinality(Color) = 2 × 3 = 6\n\nTo make sure you believe this, try listing all the possible values of (Bool, Bool) and (Bool, Color). Do they match the numbers we predicted? How about for (Color, Color)?\nBut what happens when we use infinite sets like Int and String?\n\ncardinality((Bool, String)) = 2 × ∞\ncardinality((Int, Int)) = ∞ × ∞\n\nI personally really like the idea of having two infinities. One wasn’t enough? And then seeing infinite infinities. Aren’t we going to run out at some point?\n\nNote: So far we have used tuples, but records work exactly the same way:\n\ncardinality((Bool, Bool)) = cardinality({ x : Bool, y : Bool })\ncardinality((Bool, Color)) = cardinality({ active : Bool, color : Color })\n\nAnd if you define type Point = Point Float Float then cardinality(Point) is equivalent to cardinality((Float, Float)). It is all multiplication!\n\nAddition (Custom Types)\nWhen figuring out the cardinality of a custom type, you add together the cardinality of each variant. Let’s start by looking at some Maybe and Result types:\n\ncardinality(Result Bool Color) = cardinality(Bool) + cardinality(Color) = 2 + 3 = 5\ncardinality(Maybe Bool) = 1 + cardinality(Bool) = 1 + 2 = 3\ncardinality(Maybe Int) = 1 + cardinality(Int) = 1 + ∞\n\nTo persuade yourself that this is true, try listing out all the possible values in the Maybe Bool and Result Bool Color sets. Does it match the numbers we got?\nHere are some other examples:\ntype Height\n    = Inches Int\n    | Meters Float\n\n\n\n-- cardinality(Height)\n-- = cardinality(Int) + cardinality(Float)\n-- = ∞ + ∞\n\n\ntype Location\n    = Nowhere\n    | Somewhere Float Float\n\n\n\n-- cardinality(Location)\n-- = 1 + cardinality((Float, Float))\n-- = 1 + cardinality(Float) × cardinality(Float)\n-- = 1 + ∞ × ∞\n\nLooking at custom types this way helps us see when two types are equivalent. For example, Location is equivalent to Maybe (Float, Float). Once you know that, which one should you use? I prefer Location for two reasons:\n\nThe code becomes more self-documenting. No need to wonder if Just (1.6, 1.8) is a location or a pair of heights.\nThe Maybe module may expose functions that do not make sense for my particular data. For example, combining two locations probably should not work like Maybe.map2. Should one Nowhere mean that everything is Nowhere? Seems weird!\n\nIn other words, I write a couple lines of code that are similar to other code, but it gives me a level of clarity and control that is extremely valuable for large code bases and teams.\nWho Cares?\nThinking of “types as sets” helps explain an important class of bugs: invalid data. For example, say we want to represent the color of a traffic light. The set of valid values are { red, yellow, green } but how do we represent that in code? Here are three different approaches:\n\ntype alias Color = String — We could decide that \"red\", \"yellow\", \"green\" are the three strings we will use, and that all the other ones are invalid data. But what happens if invalid data is produced? Maybe someone makes a typo like \"rad\". Maybe someone types \"RED\" instead. Should all functions have checks for incoming color arguments? Should all functions have tests to make sure color results are valid? The root issue is that cardinality(Color) = ∞, meaning there are (∞ - 3) invalid values. We will need to do a lot of checking to make sure none of them ever show up!\n\ntype alias Color = { red : Bool, yellow : Bool, green : Bool } — The idea here is that the idea of “red” is represented by Color True False False. But what about Color True True True? What does it mean for it to be all the colors at once? This is invalid data. Just like with the String representation, we end up writing checks in our code and tests to make sure there are no mistakes. In this case, cardinality(Color) = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so there are only 5 invalid values. There are definitely fewer ways to mess up, but we should still have some checks and tests.\n\ntype Color = Red | Yellow | Green — In this case, invalid data is impossible. cardinality(Color) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, exactly corresponding to the set of three values in real life. So there is no point checking for invalid color data in our code or tests. It cannot exist!\n\n\nSo the whole point here is that ruling out invalid data makes your code shorter, simpler, and more reliable. By making sure the set of possible values in code exactly matches the set of valid values in real life, many problems just go away. This is a sharp knife!\nAs your program changes, the set of possible values in code may start to diverge from the set of valid values in real life. I highly recommend revisiting your types periodically to make them match again. This is like noticing your knife has become dull and sharpening it with a whetstone. This kind of maintenance is a core part of programming in Elm.\nWhen you start thinking this way, you end up needing fewer tests, yet having more reliable code. You start using fewer dependencies, yet accomplishing things more quickly. Similarly, someone skilled with a knife probably will not buy a SlapChop. There is definitely a place for blenders and food processors, but it is smaller than you might think. No one runs ads about how you can be independent and self-sufficient without any serious downsides. No money in that!\n\nAside on Language Design\nThinking of types as sets like this can also be helpful in explaining why a language would feel “easy” or “restrictive” or “error-prone” to some people. For example:\n\nJava — There are primitive values like Bool and String. From there, you can create classes with a fixed set of fields of different types. This is much like records in Elm, allowing you to multiply cardinalities. But it is quite difficult to do addition. You can do it with subtyping, but it is quite an elaborate process. So where Result Bool Color is easy in Elm, it is pretty tough in Java. I think some people find Java “restrictive” because designing a type with cardinality 5 is quite difficult, often seeming like it is not worth the trouble.\nJavaScript — Again, there are primitive values like Bool and String. From there you can create objects with a dynamic set of fields, allowing you to multiply cardinalities. This is much more lightweight than creating classes. But like Java, doing addition is not particularly easy. For example, you can simulate Maybe Int with objects like { tag: \"just\", value: 42 } and { tag: \"nothing\" }, but this is really still multiplication of cardinality. This makes it quite difficult to exactly match the set of valid values in real life. So I think people find JavaScript “easy” because designing a type with cardinality (∞ × ∞ × ∞) is super easy and that can cover pretty much anything, but other people find it “error-prone” because designing a type with cardinality 5 is not really possible, leaving lots of space for invalid data.\n\nInterestingly, some imperative languages have custom types! Rust is a great example. They call them enums to build on the intuition folks may have from C and Java. So in Rust, addition of cardinalities is just as easy as in Elm, and it brings all the same benefits!\nI think the point here is that “addition” of types is extraordinarily underrated in general, and thinking of “types as sets” helps clarify why certain language designs would produce certain frustrations.\n\n"},"appendix/types_as_bits.html":{"url":"appendix/types_as_bits.html","title":"Types as Bits","keywords":"","body":"Types as Bits\nThere are all sorts of types in Elm:\n\nBool\nInt\nString\n(Int, Int)\nMaybe Int\n...\n\nWe have a conceptual understanding of them by now, but how are they understood by a computer? How is Maybe Int stored on a hard disk?\nBits\nA bit is little box that has two states. Zero or a one. On or off. Computer memory is one super long sequence of bits.\nOkay, so all we have is a bunch of bits. Now we need to represent everything with that!\nBool\nA Bool value can be either True or False. This corresponds exactly to a bit!\nInt\nAn Int value is some whole number like 0, 1, 2, etc. You cannot fit that in a single bit, so the only other option is to use multiple bits. So normally, an Int would be a sequence of bits, like these:\n00000000\n00000001\n00000010\n00000011\n...\nWe can arbitrarily assign meaning to each of these sequences. So maybe 00000000 is zero and 00000001 is one. Great! We can just start assigning numbers to bit sequences in ascending order. But eventually we will run out of bits...\nBy some quick math, eight bits only allow (2^8 = 256) numbers. What about perfectly reasonable numbers like 9000 and 8004?\nThe answer is to just add more bits. For a long time, people used 32 bits. That allowed for (2^32 = 4,294,967,296) numbers which covers the kinds of numbers humans typically think about. Computers these days support 64-bit integers, allowing for (2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616) numbers. That is a lot!\n\nNote: If you are curious how addition works, learn about two’s complement. It reveals that numbers are not assigned to bit sequences arbitrarily. For the sake of making addition as fast as possible, this particular way of assigning numbers works really well.\n\nString\nThe string \"abc\" is the sequence of characters a b c, so we will start by trying to represent characters as bits.\nOne of the early ways of encoding characters is called ASCII. Just like with integers, they decided to list out a bunch of bit sequences and start assigning values arbitrarily:\n00000000\n00000001\n00000010\n00000011\n...\nSo every character needed to fit in eight bits, meaning only 256 characters could be represented! But if you only care about English, this actually works out pretty well. You need to cover 26 lower-case letters, 26 upper-case letters, and 10 numbers. That is 62. There is a bunch of room left for symbols and other weird stuff. You can see what they ended up with here.\nWe have an idea for characters now, but how will the computer know where the String ends and the next piece of data begins? It is all just bits. Characters look just like Int values really! So we need some way to mark the end.\nThese days, languages tend to do this by storing the length of the string. So a string like \"hello\" might look something like 5 h e l l o in memory. So you know a String always starts with 32-bits representing the length. And whether the length is 0 or 9000, you know exactly where the characters end.\n\nNote: At some point, folks wanted to cover languages besides English. This effort eventually resulted in the UTF-8 encoding. It is quite brilliant really, and I encourage you to learn about it. It turns out that “get the 5th character” is harder than it sounds!\n\n(Int, Int)\nWhat about tuples? Well, (Int, Int) is two Int values, and each one is a sequence of bits. Let’s just put those two sequences next to each other in memory and call it a day!\nCustom Types\nA custom type is all about combining different types. Those different types may have all sorts of different shapes. We will start with the Color type:\ntype Color\n    = Red\n    | Yellow\n    | Green\n\nWe can assign each case a number: Red = 0, Yellow = 1, and Green = 2. Now we can use the Int representation. Here we only need two bits to cover all the possible cases, so 00 is red, 01 is yellow, 10 is green, and 11 is unused.\nBut what about custom types that hold additional data? Like Maybe Int? The typical approach is to set aside some bits to “tag” the data, so we can decide that Nothing = 0 and Just = 1. Here are some examples:\n\nNothing = 0\nJust 12 = 1 00001100\nJust 16 = 1 00010000\n\nA case expression always looks at that “tag” before deciding what to do next. If it sees a 0 it knows there is no more data. If it sees a 1 it knows it is followed by a sequence of bits representing the data.\nThis “tag” idea is similar to putting the length at the beginning of String values. The values may be different sizes, but the code can always figure out where they start and end.\nSummary\nEventually, all values need to be represented in bits. This page gives a rough overview of how that actually works.\nNormally there is no real reason to think about this, but I found it to be helpful in deepening my understanding of custom types and case expressions. I hope it is helpful to you as well!\n\nNote: If you think this is interesting, it may be fun to learn more about garbage collection. I have found The Garbage Collection Handbook to be an excellent resource on the topic!\n\n"},"types/type_aliases.html":{"url":"types/type_aliases.html","title":"Type Aliases","keywords":"","body":"Type Aliases\nType annotations can start to get long. This might be a real problem if you have records with many fields! This is the core motivation for type aliases. A type alias is a shorter name for a type. For example, you could create a User alias like this:\ntype alias User =\n    { name : String\n    , age : Int\n    }\n\nRather than writing the whole record type all the time, we can just say User instead. This helps us write type annotations that are easier to read:\n-- WITH ALIAS\n\n\nisOldEnoughToVote : User -> Bool\nisOldEnoughToVote user =\n    user.age >= 18\n\n\n\n-- WITHOUT ALIAS\n\n\nisOldEnoughToVote : { name : String, age : Int } -> Bool\nisOldEnoughToVote user =\n    user.age >= 18\n\nThese two definitions are equivalent, but the one with a type alias is shorter and easier to read. So all we are doing is making an alias for a long type.\nModels\nIt is extremely common to use type aliases when designing a model. When we were learning about The Elm Architecture, we saw a model like this:\ntype alias Model =\n  { name : String\n  , password : String\n  , passwordAgain : String\n  }\nThe main benefit of using a type alias for this is when we write the type annotations for the update and view functions. Writing Msg -> Model -> Model is so much nicer than the fully expanded version! It has the added benefit that we can add fields to our model without needing to change any type annotations.\nRecord Constructors\nWhen you create a type alias specifically for a record, it also generates a record constructor. So if we define a User type alias, we can start building records like this:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-type\": \"User\",\n        \"input\": \"type alias User = { name : String, age : Int }\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"User\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> Int -> User\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"User \\\"Sue\\\" 58\",\n        \"value\": \"{ \\u001b[37mname\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"Sue\\\"\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mage\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[95m58\\u001b[0m }\",\n        \"type_\": \"User\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"User \\\"Tom\\\" 31\",\n        \"value\": \"{ \\u001b[37mname\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"Tom\\\"\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mage\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[95m31\\u001b[0m }\",\n        \"type_\": \"User\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nTry creating another user or creating a type alias of your own ⬆️\nNote that the order of arguments in the record constructor match the order of fields in the type alias!\nAnd again, this is only for records. Making type aliases for other types will not result in a constructor.\n"},"types/custom_types.html":{"url":"types/custom_types.html","title":"Custom Types","keywords":"","body":"\nNote: Custom types used to be referred to as “union types” in Elm. Names from other communities include tagged unions and ADTs.\n\nCustom Types\nSo far we have seen a bunch of types like Bool, Int, and String. But how do we define our own?\nSay we are making a chat room. Everyone needs a name, but maybe some users do not have a permanent account. They just give a name each time they show up.\nWe can describe this situation by defining a UserStatus type, listing all the possible variations:\ntype UserStatus\n    = Regular\n    | Visitor\n\nThe UserStatus type has two variants. Someone can be a Regular or a Visitor. So we could represent a user as a record like this:\ntype UserStatus\n    = Regular\n    | Visitor\n\n\ntype alias User =\n    { status : UserStatus\n    , name : String\n    }\n\n\nthomas =\n    { status = Regular, name = \"Thomas\" }\n\n\nkate95 =\n    { status = Visitor, name = \"kate95\" }\n\nSo now we can track if someone is a Regular with an account or a Visitor who is just passing through. It is not too tough, but we can make it simpler!\nRather than creating a custom type and a type alias, we can represent all this with just a single custom type. The Regular and Visitor variants each have an associated data. In our case, the associated data is a String value:\ntype User\n    = Regular String\n    | Visitor String\n\n\nthomas =\n    Regular \"Thomas\"\n\n\nkate95 =\n    Visitor \"kate95\"\n\nThe data is attached directly to the variant, so there is no need for the record anymore.\nAnother benefit of this approach is that each variant can have different associated data. Say that Regular users gave their age when they signed up. There is no nice way to capture that with records, but when you define your own custom type it is no problem. Let's add some associated data to the Regular variant in an interactive example:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"add-type\": \"User\",\n    \"input\": \"type User\\n  = Regular String Int\\n  | Visitor String\\n\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"Regular\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"String -> Int -> User\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"Visitor\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"String -> User\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"Regular \\\"Thomas\\\" 44\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mRegular\\u001b[0m \\u001b[93m\\\"Thomas\\\"\\u001b[0m \\u001b[95m44\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"User\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"Visitor \\\"kate95\\\"\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mVisitor\\u001b[0m \\u001b[93m\\\"kate95\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"User\"\n  }\n]\n\n\nTry defining a Regular visitor with a name and age ⬆️\nWe only added an age, but variants of a type can diverge quite dramatically. For example, maybe we want to add location for Regular users so we can suggest regional chat rooms. Add more associated data! Or maybe we want to have anonymous users. Add a third variant called Anonymous. Maybe we end up with:\ntype User\n    = Regular String Int Location\n    | Visitor String\n    | Anonymous\n\nNo problem! Let’s see some other examples now.\nMessages\nIn the architecture section, we saw a couple of examples of defining a Msg type. This sort of type is extremely common in Elm. In our chat room, we might define a Msg type like this:\ntype Msg\n    = PressedEnter\n    | ChangedDraft String\n    | ReceivedMessage { user : User, message : String }\n    | ClickedExit\n\nWe have four variants. Some variants have no associated data, others have a bunch. Notice that ReceivedMessage actually has a record as associated data. That is totally fine. Any type can be associated data! This allows you to describe interactions in your application very precisely.\nModeling\nCustom types become extremely powerful when you start modeling situations very precisely. For example, if you are waiting for some data to load, you might want to model it with a custom type like this:\ntype Profile\n    = Failure\n    | Loading\n    | Success { name : String, description : String }\n\nSo you can start in the Loading state and then transition to Failure or Success depending on what happens. This makes it really simple to write a view function that always shows something reasonable when data is loading.\nNow we know how to create custom types, the next section will show how to use them!\n\nNote: Custom types are the most important feature in Elm. They have a lot of depth, especially once you get in the habit of trying to model scenarios more precisely. I tried to share some of this depth in Types as Sets and Types as Bits in the appendix. I hope you find them helpful!\n\n"},"error_handling/maybe.html":{"url":"error_handling/maybe.html","title":"Maybe","keywords":"","body":"Maybe\nAs you work more with Elm, you will start seeing the Maybe type quite frequently. It is defined like this:\ntype Maybe a\n    = Just a\n    | Nothing\n\n\n\n-- Just 3.14 : Maybe Float\n-- Just \"hi\" : Maybe String\n-- Just True : Maybe Bool\n-- Nothing   : Maybe a\n\nThis is a type with two variants. You either have Nothing or you have Just a value. The type variable makes it possible to have a Maybe Float and Maybe String depending on the particular value.\nThis can be handy in two main scenarios: partial functions and optional fields.\nPartial Functions\nSometimes you want a function that gives an answer for some inputs, but not others. Many people run into this with String.toFloat when trying to convert user input into numbers. Let's see it in action:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"input\": \"String.toFloat\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"String -> Maybe Float\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"String.toFloat \\\"3.1415\\\"\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mJust\\u001b[0m \\u001b[95m3.1415\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"Maybe Float\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": \"String.toFloat \\\"abc\\\"\",\n    \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mNothing\\u001b[0m\",\n    \"type_\": \"Maybe Float\"\n  }\n]\n\n\nTry calling String.toFloat with other strings to see what happens ⬆️\nNot all strings make sense as numbers, so this function models that explicitly. Can a string be turned into a float? Maybe! From there we can pattern match on the resulting data and continue as appropriate.\n\nExercise: I wrote a little program here that converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Try refactoring the view code in different ways. Can you put a red border around invalid input? Can you add more conversions? Fahrenheit to Celsius? Inches to Meters?\n\nOptional Fields\nAnother place you commonly see Maybe values is in records with optional fields.\nFor example, say we are running a social networking website. Connecting people, friendship, etc. You know the spiel. The Onion outlined our real goals best back in 2011: mine as much data as possible for the CIA. And if we want all the data, we need to ease people into it. Let them add it later. Add features that encourage them to share more and more information over time.\nSo let's start with a simple model of a user. They must have a name, but we are going to make the age optional.\ntype alias User =\n    { name : String\n    , age : Maybe Int\n    }\n\nNow say Sue creates an account, but decides not to provide her birthday:\nsue : User\nsue =\n    { name = \"Sue\", age = Nothing }\n\nSue’s friends cannot wish her a happy birthday though. I wonder if they really care about her... Later Tom creates a profile and does give his age:\ntom : User\ntom =\n    { name = \"Tom\", age = Just 24 }\n\nGreat, that will be nice on his birthday. But more importantly, Tom is part of a valuable demographic! The advertisers will be pleased.\nAlright, so now that we have some users, how can we market alcohol to them without breaking any laws? People would probably be mad if we market to people under 21, so let's check for that:\ncanBuyAlcohol : User -> Bool\ncanBuyAlcohol user =\n    case user.age of\n        Nothing ->\n            False\n\n        Just age ->\n            age >= 21\n\nNotice that the Maybe type forces us to pattern match on the user's age. It is actually impossible to write code where you forget that users may not have an age. Elm makes sure of it! Now we can advertise alcohol confident that we are not influencing minors directly! Only their older peers.\nAvoiding Overuse\nThis Maybe type is quite useful, but there are limits. Beginners are particularly prone to getting excited about Maybe and using it everywhere, even though a custom type would be more appropriate.\nFor example, say we have an exercise app where we compete against our friends. You start with a list of your friend’s names, but you can load more fitness information about them later. You might be tempted to model it like this:\ntype alias Friend =\n    { name : String\n    , age : Maybe Int\n    , height : Maybe Float\n    , weight : Maybe Float\n    }\n\nAll the information is there, but you are not really modeling the way your particular application works. It would be much more precise to model it like this instead:\ntype Friend\n    = Less String\n    | More String Info\n\n\ntype alias Info =\n    { age : Int\n    , height : Float\n    , weight : Float\n    }\n\nThis new model is capturing much more about your application. There are only two real situations. Either you have just the name, or you have the name and a bunch of information. In your view code, you just think about whether you are showing a Less or More view of the friend. You do not have to answer questions like “what if I have an age but not a weight?” That is not possible with our more precise type!\nPoint is, if you find yourself using Maybe everywhere, it is worth examining your type and type alias definitions to see if you can find a more precise representation. This often leads to a lot of nice refactors in your update and view code!\n\nAside: Connection to null references\nThe inventor of null references, Tony Hoare, described them like this:\n\nI call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.\n\nThat design makes failure implicit. Any time you think you have a String you just might have a null instead. Should you check? Did the person giving you the value check? Maybe it will be fine? Maybe it will crash your server? I guess we will find out later!\nElm avoids these problems by not having null references at all. We instead use custom types like Maybe to make failure explicit. This way there are never any surprises. A String is always a String, and when you see a Maybe String, the compiler will ensure that both variants are accounted for. This way you get the same flexibility, but without the surprise crashes.\n\n"},"interop/custom_elements.html":{"url":"interop/custom_elements.html","title":"Custom Elements","keywords":"","body":"Custom Elements\nOn the last few pages, we have seen (1) how to start Elm programs from JavaScript, (2) how to pass data in as flags on initialization, and (3) how to send messages between Elm and JS with ports. But guess what people? There is another way to do interop!\nBrowsers seem to be supporting custom elements more and more, and that turns out to be quite helpful for embedding JS into Elm programs.\nHere is a minimal example of how to use custom elements to do some localization and internationalization.\nCreating Custom Elements\nSay we want to localize dates, but that is not accessible in Elm core packages yet. Maybe you want to write a function that localizes dates:\n//\n//   localizeDate('sr-RS', 12, 5) === \"петак, 1. јун 2012.\"\n//   localizeDate('en-GB', 12, 5) === \"Friday, 1 June 2012\"\n//   localizeDate('en-US', 12, 5) === \"Friday, June 1, 2012\"\n//\nfunction localizeDate(lang, year, month) {\n  const dateTimeFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(lang, {\n    weekday: \"long\",\n    year: \"numeric\",\n    month: \"long\",\n    day: \"numeric\",\n  });\n\n  return dateTimeFormat.format(new Date(year, month));\n}\n\nBut how do we use that in Elm?! Newer browsers allow you to create new types of DOM nodes like this:\n//\n//   \n//   \n//   \n//\ncustomElements.define(\n  \"intl-date\",\n  class extends HTMLElement {\n    // things required by Custom Elements\n    constructor() {\n      super();\n    }\n    connectedCallback() {\n      this.setTextContent();\n    }\n    attributeChangedCallback() {\n      this.setTextContent();\n    }\n    static get observedAttributes() {\n      return [\"lang\", \"year\", \"month\"];\n    }\n\n    // Our function to set the textContent based on attributes.\n    setTextContent() {\n      const lang = this.getAttribute(\"lang\");\n      const year = this.getAttribute(\"year\");\n      const month = this.getAttribute(\"month\");\n      this.textContent = localizeDate(lang, year, month);\n    }\n  },\n);\n\nThe most important parts here are attributeChangedCallback and observedAttributes. You need some logic like that to detect changes to the attributes you care about.\nLoad that before you initialize your Elm code, and you will be able to write code like this in Elm:\nimport Html exposing (Html, node)\nimport Html.Attributes exposing (attribute)\n\n\nviewDate : String -> Int -> Int -> Html msg\nviewDate lang year month =\n    node \"intl-date\"\n        [ attribute \"lang\" lang\n        , attribute \"year\" (String.fromInt year)\n        , attribute \"month\" (String.fromInt month)\n        ]\n        []\n\nNow you can call viewDate when you want access to that kind of localized information in your view.\nYou can check out the full version of this example here.\nMore Info\nLuke has a lot more experience with custom elements, and I think his Elm Europe talk is an excellent introduction!\nundefined\nDocs on custom elements can be kind of confusing, but I hope this is enough for people to get started embedding simple logic for Intl or even large React widgets if that seems like the right choice for your project.\n"},"appendix/function_types.html":{"url":"appendix/function_types.html","title":"Function Types","keywords":"","body":"Function Types\nAs you look through packages like elm/core and elm/html, you will definitely see functions with multiple arrows. For example:\nString.repeat : Int -> String -> String\nString.join : String -> List String -> String\n\nWhy so many arrows? What is going on here?!\nHidden Parentheses\nIt starts to become clearer when you see all the parentheses. For example, it is also valid to write the type of String.repeat like this:\nString.repeat : Int -> (String -> String)\n\nIt is a function that takes an Int and then produces another function. Let's see this in action:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.repeat\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int -> String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.repeat 4\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.repeat 4 \\\"ha\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"hahahaha\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.join\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> List String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.join \\\"|\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"List String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.join \\\"|\\\" [\\\"red\\\",\\\"yellow\\\",\\\"green\\\"]\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"red|yellow|green\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nSo conceptually, every function accepts one argument. It may return another function that accepts one argument. Etc. At some point it will stop returning functions.\nWe could always put the parentheses to indicate that this is what is really happening, but it starts to get pretty unwieldy when you have multiple arguments. It is the same logic behind writing 4 * 2 + 5 * 3 instead of (4 * 2) + (5 * 3). It means there is a bit extra to learn, but it is so common that it is worth it.\nFine, but what is the point of this feature in the first place? Why not do (Int, String) -> String and give all the arguments at once?\nPartial Application\nIt is quite common to use the List.map function in Elm programs:\nList.map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b\n\nIt takes two arguments: a function and a list. From there it transforms every element in the list with that function. Here are some examples:\n\nList.map String.reverse [\"part\",\"are\"] == [\"trap\",\"era\"]\nList.map String.length [\"part\",\"are\"] == [4,3]\n\nNow remember how String.repeat 4 had type String -> String on its own? Well, that means we can say:\n\nList.map (String.repeat 2) [\"ha\",\"choo\"] == [\"haha\",\"choochoo\"]\n\nThe expression (String.repeat 2) is a String -> String function, so we can use it directly. No need to say (\\str -> String.repeat 2 str).\nElm also uses the convention that the data structure is always the last argument across the ecosystem. This means that functions are usually designed with this possible usage in mind, making this a pretty common technique.\nNow it is important to remember that this can be overused! It is convenient and clear sometimes, but I find it is best used in moderation. So I always recommend breaking out top-level helper functions when things get even a little complicated. That way it has a clear name, the arguments are named, and it is easy to test this new helper function. In our example, that means creating:\n-- List.map reduplicate [\"ha\",\"choo\"]\n\n\nreduplicate : String -> String\nreduplicate string =\n    String.repeat 2 string\n\nThis case is really simple, but (1) it is now clearer that I am interested in the linguistic phenomenon known as reduplication and (2) it will be quite easy to add new logic to reduplicate as my program evolves. Maybe I want shm-reduplication support at some point?\nIn other words, if your partial application is getting long, make it a helper function. And if it is multi-line, it should definitely be turned into a top-level helper! This advice applies to using anonymous functions too.\n\nNote: If you are ending up with “too many” functions when you use this advice, I recommend using comments like -- REDUPLICATION to give an overview of the next five or ten functions. Old school! I have shown this with -- UPDATE and -- VIEW comments in previous examples, but it is a generic technique that I use in all my code. And if you are worried about files getting too long with this advice, I recommend watching The Life of a File!\n\nPipelines\nElm also has a pipe operator that relies on partial application. For example, say we have a sanitize function for turning user input into integers:\n-- BEFORE\n\n\nsanitize : String -> Maybe Int\nsanitize input =\n    String.toInt (String.trim input)\n\nWe can rewrite it like this:\n-- AFTER\n\n\nsanitize : String -> Maybe Int\nsanitize input =\n    input\n        |> String.trim\n        |> String.toInt\n\nSo in this “pipeline” we pass the input to String.trim and then that gets passed along to String.toInt.\nThis is neat because it allows a “left-to-right” reading that many people like, but pipelines can be overused! When you have three or four steps, the code often gets clearer if you break out a top-level helper function. Now the transformation has a name. The arguments are named. It has a type annotation. It is much more self-documenting that way, and your teammates and your future self will appreciate it! Testing the logic gets easier too.\n\nNote: I personally prefer the BEFORE, but perhaps that is just because I learned functional programming in languages without pipes!\n\n"},"types/reading_types.html":{"url":"types/reading_types.html","title":"Reading Types","keywords":"","body":"Reading Types\nIn the Core Language section of this book, we went through a bunch of interactive examples to get a feeling for the language. Well, we are going to do it again, but with a new question in mind. What type of value is that?\nPrimitives and Lists\nLet's enter some simple expressions and see what happens:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"\\\"hello\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"hello\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"not True\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mFalse\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Bool\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"round 3.1415\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nClick on this black box ⬆️ and the cursor should start blinking. Type in 3.1415 and press the ENTER key. It should print out 3.1415 followed by the type Float.\nOkay, but what is going on here exactly? Each entry shows value along with what type of value it happens to be. You can read these examples out loud like this:\n\nThe value \"hello\" is a String.\nThe value False is a Bool.\nThe value 3 is an Int.\nThe value 3.1415 is a Float.\n\nElm is able to figure out the type of any value you enter! Let's see what happens with lists:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"[ \\\"Alice\\\", \\\"Bob\\\" ]\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[93m\\\"Alice\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"Bob\\\"\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"[ 1.0, 8.6, 42.1 ]\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[95m1.0\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m8.6\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m42.1\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List Float\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nYou can read these types as:\n\nWe have a List filled with String values.\nWe have a List filled with Float values.\n\nThe type is a rough description of the particular value we are looking at.\nFunctions\nLet's see the type of some functions:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.length\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> Int\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nTry entering round or sqrt to see some other function types ⬆️\nThe String.length function has type String -> Int. This means it must take in a String argument, and it will definitely return an Int value. So let's try giving it an argument:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.length \\\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m34\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nSo we start with a String -> Int function and give it a String argument. This results in an Int.\nWhat happens when you do not give a String though? Try entering String.length [1,2,3] or String.length True to see what happens ⬆️\nYou will find that a String -> Int function must get a String argument!\n\n\nNote: Functions that take multiple arguments end up having more and more arrows. For example, here is a function that takes two arguments:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"String.repeat\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int -> String -> String\"\n    }\n]\n\nGiving two arguments like String.repeat 3 \"ha\" will produce \"hahaha\". It works to think of -> as a weird way to separate arguments, but I explain the real reasoning here. It is pretty neat!\n\n\nType Annotations\nSo far we have just let Elm figure out the types, but it also lets you write a type annotation on the line above a definition. So when you are writing code, you can say things like this:\nhalf : Float -> Float\nhalf n =\n    n / 2\n\n\n\n-- half 256 == 128\n-- half \"3\" -- error!\n\n\nhypotenuse : Float -> Float -> Float\nhypotenuse a b =\n    sqrt (a ^ 2 + b ^ 2)\n\n\n\n-- hypotenuse 3 4  == 5\n-- hypotenuse 5 12 == 13\n\n\ncheckPower : Int -> String\ncheckPower powerLevel =\n    if powerLevel > 9000 then\n        \"It's over 9000!!!\"\n\n    else\n        \"Meh\"\n\n\n\n-- checkPower 9001 == \"It's over 9000!!!\"\n-- checkPower True -- error!\n\nAdding type annotations is not required, but it is definitely recommended! Benefits include:\n\nError Message Quality — When you add a type annotation, it tells the compiler what you are trying to do. Your implementation may have mistakes, and now the compiler can compare against your stated intent. “You said argument powerLevel was an Int, but it is getting used as a String!”\nDocumentation — When you revisit code later (or when a colleague visits it for the first time) it can be really helpful to see exactly what is going in and out of the function without having to read the implementation super carefully.\n\nPeople can make mistakes in type annotations though, so what happens if the annotation does not match the implementation? The compiler figures out all the types on its own, and it checks that your annotation matches the real answer. In other words, the compiler will always verify that all the annotations you add are correct. So you get better error messages and documentation always stays up to date!\nType Variables\nAs you look through more Elm code, you will start to see type annotations with lower-case letters in them. A common example is the List.length function:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.length\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"List a -> Int\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nNotice that lower-case a in the type? That is called a type variable. It can vary depending on how List.length is used:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.length [1,1,2,3,5,8]\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m6\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.length [ \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\", \\\"c\\\" ]\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.length [ True, False ]\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m2\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Int\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nWe just want the length, so it does not matter what is in the list. So the type variable a is saying that we can match any type. Let’s look at another common example:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.reverse\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"List a -> List a\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.reverse [ \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\", \\\"c\\\" ]\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[93m\\\"c\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"b\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"a\\\"\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.reverse [ True, False ]\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[96mFalse\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[96mTrue\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List Bool\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nAgain, the type variable a can vary depending on how List.reverse is used. But in this case, we have an a in the argument and in the result. This means that if you give a List Int you must get a List Int as well. Once we decide what a is, that’s what it is everywhere.\n\nNote: Type variables must start with a lower-case letter, but they can be full words. We could write the type of List.length as List value -> Int and we could write the type of List.reverse as List element -> List element. It is fine as long as they start with a lower-case letter. Type variables a and b are used by convention in many places, but some type annotations benefit from more specific names.\n\nConstrained Type Variables\nThere is a special variant of type variables in Elm called constrained type variables. The most common example is the number type. The negate function uses it:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"negate\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"number -> number\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nTry expressions like negate 3.1415 and negate (round 3.1415) and negate \"hi\" ⬆️\nNormally type variables can get filled in with anything, but number can only be filled in by Int and Float values. It constrains the possibilities.\nThe full list of constrained type variables is:\n\nnumber permits Int and Float\nappendable permits String and List a\ncomparable permits Int, Float, Char, String, and lists/tuples of comparable values\ncompappend permits String and List comparable\n\nThese constrained type variables exist to make operators like (+) and ( a bit more flexible.\nBy now we have covered types for values and functions pretty well, but what does this look like when we start wanting more complex data structures?\n"},"core_language.html":{"url":"core_language.html","title":"Core Language","keywords":"","body":"Lo esencial del lenguaje\nIntentemos primero construir una intuición sobre cómo funciona Elm.\nEl objetivo es familiarizarnos con valores y funciones, y tomar confianza para cuando nos enfrentemos a ejemplos más largos de código.\nValores\nLa unidad más básica en Elm se llama un valor. Todos estos son valores: 42, True, \"¡Hola!\".\nVeamos primero los números.\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"1 + 1\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m2\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"number\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nTodos los ejemplos en esta página son interactivos. Si apretas sobre esta caja negra ⬆️ vas a ver que el cursor de texto va a empezar a pestañear. Escribe 2 + 2 y apreta ENTER. Deberías ver que aparece 4 como resultado. Recuerda que puedes interactuar de la misma forma con todos los demás ejemplos en este documento.\nPrueba escribir algo como 30 * 60 * 1000 o 2 ^ 4. Verás que funciona igual que una calculadora.\nEstá bien hacer aritmética, pero es algo sorprendentemente poco común en la mayoría de programas que uno escribe. Es mucho más frecuente manipular textos, lo que en informática se llama técnicamente string. Algo así:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"\\\"hello\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"hello\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"\\\"butter\\\" ++ \\\"fly\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"butterfly\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nPrueba unir varios strings con el operador (++) ⬆️\nEstos valores primitivos se vuelven más interesantes a medida que escribamos funciones para transformarlos.\n\nNota: Puedes leer más sobre distintos operadores, como (+), (/) y (++) en la documentación del módulo Basics. Lamentablemente, esta documentación está en inglés, pero está escrita en un lenguaje muy poco técnico, y aunque sea con traducción automática, creo que vale la pena darle una leída una vez que te parezca apropiado.\n\nFunciones\nUna función es una forma de transformar valores. Éstas toman algunos valores, y producen un nuevo valor.\nPor ejemplo, esta es una función greet que recibe un nombre y dice “hola”:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"greet\",\n        \"input\": \"greet name =\\n  \\\"Hello \\\" ++ name ++ \\\"!\\\"\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"greet \\\"Alice\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"Hello Alice!\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"greet \\\"Bob\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"Hello Bob!\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nTrata saludar a alguna otra persona, como a \"Stokely\" o a \"Kwame\" ⬆️\nLos valores que le pasas a la función se suelen llamar argumentos, así que podríamos decir que greet es una función que recibe un argumento.\nBien, ahora que terminamos las formalidades, ¿qué te parece si probamos una función madlib que recibe dos argumentos?\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"madlib\",\n        \"input\": \"madlib animal adjective =\\n  \\\"The ostentatious \\\" ++ animal ++ \\\" wears \\\" ++ adjective ++ \\\" shorts.\\\"\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"madlib \\\"cat\\\" \\\"ergonomic\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"The ostentatious cat wears ergonomic shorts.\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"madlib (\\\"butter\\\" ++ \\\"fly\\\") \\\"metallic\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"The ostentatious butterfly wears metallic shorts.\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nIntenta darle dos argumentos a la función madlib ⬆️\nObserva que usamos paréntesis para agrupar \"butter\" ++ \"fly\" en el segundo ejemplo. Cada argumento necesita ser un valor primitivo, como \"gato\", y si no, necesitas usar paréntesis.\n\nNota: Si estás habituado a lenguajes como JavaScript, te puede sorprender que las funciones se ven distintas:\nmadlib \"cat\" \"ergonomic\"                  -- Elm\nmadlib(\"cat\", \"ergonomic\")                // JavaScript\n\nmadlib (\"butter\" ++ \"fly\") \"metallic\"      -- Elm\nmadlib(\"butter\" + \"fly\", \"metallic\")       // JavaScript\nTe puede parecer raro al principio, pero para este estilo necesitamos usar menos paréntesis y comas. Cuando te acostumbres vas a ver que el lenguaje se siente más simple y limpio.\n\nExpresiones if\nCuando necesitas comportamiento condicional en Elm, puedes usar una expresión if.\nCreemos una nueva función greet que es adecuadamente respetuosa con el expresidente Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"greet\",\n        \"input\": \"greet name =\\n  if name == \\\"Abraham Lincoln\\\" then\\n    \\\"Greetings Mr. President!\\\"\\n  else\\n    \\\"Hey!\\\"\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"greet \\\"Tom\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"Hey!\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"greet \\\"Abraham Lincoln\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[93m\\\"Greetings Mr. President!\\\"\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nProbablemente hay más casos que podríamos cubrir, pero por ahora, con esto basta.\nListas\nLas listas son unas de las estructuras de datos más comunes en Elm. Sirven para albergar una secuencia de cosas relacionadas, similar a los “arrays” en JavaScript.\nUna lista puede contener muchos valores. Dichos valores deben tener todos el mismo tipo. Aquí tienes algunos ejemplos que usan funciones del módulo List:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"names\",\n        \"input\": \"names =\\n  [ \\\"Alice\\\", \\\"Bob\\\", \\\"Chuck\\\" ]\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[93m\\\"Alice\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"Bob\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"Chuck\\\"\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.isEmpty names\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[96mFalse\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"Bool\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.length names\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.reverse names\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[93m\\\"Chuck\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"Bob\\\"\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[93m\\\"Alice\\\"\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List String\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"numbers\",\n        \"input\": \"numbers =\\n  [4,3,2,1]\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[95m4\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m2\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m1\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List number\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.sort numbers\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[95m1\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m2\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m4\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List number\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"increment\",\n        \"input\": \"increment n =\\n  n + 1\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"number -> number\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"List.map increment numbers\",\n        \"value\": \"[\\u001b[95m5\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m4\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m3\\u001b[0m,\\u001b[95m2\\u001b[0m]\",\n        \"type_\": \"List number\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nPrueba construir tu propia lista, y usa funciones como List.length ⬆️\n¡Recuerda que todos los elementos de la lista deben siempre tener el mismo tipo!\nTuplas\nLas tuplas son otra estructura de datos muy útil. Una tupla puede contener dos o tres valores, y cada valor puede tener cualquier tipo. Un uso común es para devolver más de un valor desde una función. La siguiente función recibe un nombre y devuelve un mensaje al usuario:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"isGoodName\",\n        \"input\": \"isGoodName name =\\n  if String.length name \\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"String -> ( Bool, String )\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"isGoodName \\\"Tom\\\"\",\n        \"value\": \"(\\u001b[96mTrue\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[93m\\\"name accepted!\\\"\\u001b[0m)\",\n        \"type_\": \"( Bool, String )\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nEs una estructura muy útil, pero cuando las cosas se ponen más complicadas, es mejor usar registros en vez de tuplas.\nRegistros\nUn registro puede contener muchos valores, y cada valor lleva un nombre asociado.\nEste es un registro que representa al economista inglés John A.

El registro original no ha sido sobreescrito. Elm permite hacer esto en forma eficiente, compartiendo todo lo que pueda entre ambos. Si actualizas uno en diez campos, el nuevo registro va a compartir los otros nueve.\nDicho esto, una función que actualiza la edad quedaría así:\n\n\n[\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"celebrateBirthday\",\n        \"input\": \"celebrateBirthday person =\\n  { person | age = person.age + 1 }\\n\",\n        \"value\": \"\\u001b[36m\\u001b[0m\",\n        \"type_\": \"{ a | age : number } -> { a | age : number }\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"add-decl\": \"john\",\n        \"input\": \"john = { first = \\\"John\\\", last = \\\"Hobson\\\", age = 81 }\",\n        \"value\": \"{ \\u001b[37mage\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[95m81\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mfirst\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"John\\\"\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mlast\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"Hobson\\\"\\u001b[0m }\",\n        \"type_\": \"{ age : number, first : String, last : String }\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": \"celebrateBirthday john\",\n        \"value\": \"{ \\u001b[37mage\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[95m82\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mfirst\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"John\\\"\\u001b[0m, \\u001b[37mlast\\u001b[0m = \\u001b[93m\\\"Hobson\\\"\\u001b[0m }\",\n        \"type_\": \"{ age : number, first : String, last : String }\"\n    }\n]\n\n\nActualizar campos en registros es algo muy común, así que vamos a ver muchos más ejemplos en la próxima sección.\n"}}}
